The aim of Machine Learning is to build computer systems that can adapt to their environments and learn form experience. Learning techniques and methods from this field are successfully applied to a variety of learning tasks in a broad range of areas, including, for example, spam recognition, text classification, gene discovery, financial forecasting. The course will give an overview of many concepts, techniques, and algorithms in machine learning, beginning with topics such as linear regression and classification and ending up with topics such as kmeans and Expectation Maximization. The course will give the student the basic ideas and intuition behind these methods, as well as a more formal statistical and computational understanding. Students will have an opportunity to experiment with machine learning techniques in R and apply them to a selected problem. Course Overview "],
["introduction.html", "Introduction What is Machine Learning ? Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning", " Introduction What is Machine Learning ? What is Machine Learning? Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” This is an older, informal definition. Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.” Machine Learning is also called Statistical Learning. Example: playing checkers. E = the experience of playing many games of checkers T = the task of playing checkers. P = the probability that the program will win the next game. In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications: Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning. Supervised Learning Supervised Learning is probably the most common type of machine learning problem. Let’s start with an example of what is it. Let’s say we want to predict housing prices. We plot a data set and it looks like this. Here on the horizontal axis, the size of different houses in square feet, and on the vertical axis, the price of different houses in thousands of dollars. So. Given this data, let’s say we own a house that is, say 750 square feet and hoping to sell the house and we want to know how much we can get for the house. So how can the learning algorithm help? One thing a learning algorithm might be able to do is put a straight line through the data or to “fit” a straight line to the data and, based on that, it looks like maybe the house can be sold for maybe about $150,000. But maybe this isn’t the only learning algorithm we can use. There might be a better one. For example, instead of sending a straight line to the data, we might decide that it’s better to fit a quadratic function or a second-order polynomial to this data. If we do that, and make a prediction here, then it looks like, well, maybe we can sell the house for closer to $200,000. This is an example of a supervised learning algorithm. The term supervised learning refers to the fact that we gave the algorithm a data set in which the “right answers” were given. The example above is also called a regression problem. A regression problem is when we try to predict a continuous value output. Namely the price in the example. Here’s another supervised learning example. Let’s say we want to look at medical records and try to predict of a breast cancer as malignant or benign. If someone discovers a breast tumor, a lump in their breast, a malignant tumor is a tumor that is harmful and dangerous and a benign tumor is a tumor that is harmless. Let’s see a collected data set and suppose in the data set we have the size of the tumor on the horizontal axis and on the vertical axis we plot one or zero, yes or no, whether or not these are examples of tumors we’ve seen before are malignant (which is one) or zero if not malignant or benign. In this data set we have five examples of benign tumors, and five examples of malignant tumors. Let’s say a person who tragically has a breast tumor, and let’s say her breast tumor size is known (rose arrow in the following figure). The machine learning question is, can you estimate what is the probability that a tumor is malignant versus benign? To introduce a bit more terminology this is an example of a classification problem. The term classification refers to the fact that here we’re trying to predict a discrete value output: zero or one, malignant or benign. And it turns out that in classification problems sometimes you can have more than two values for the two possible values for the output. In classification problems there is another way to plot this data. Let’s use a slightly different set of symbols to plot this data. So if tumor size is going to be the attribute that we are going to use to predict malignancy or benignness, we can also draw the data like this. All we did was we took the data set on top and just mapped it down using different symbols. So instead of drawing crosses, we are now going to draw O’s for the benign tumors. Now, in this example we use only one feature or one attribute, mainly, the tumor size in order to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign. In other machine learning problems we may have more than one feature. Here’s an example. Let’s say that instead of just knowing the tumor size, we know both the age of the patients and the tumor size. In that case maybe the data set will look like this. So, let’s say a person who tragically has a tumor. And maybe, their tumor size and age falls around there (rose point): So given a data set like this, what the learning algorithm might do is throw a straight line through the data to try to separate out the malignant tumors from the benign ones. And with this, hopefully we can decide that the person’s tumor falls on this benign side and is therefore more likely to be benign than malignant. In this example we had two features, namely, the age of the patient and the size of the tumor. In other machine learning problems we will often have more features. Most interesting learning algorithms is a learning algorithm that can deal with, not just two or three or five features, but an infinite number of features. So how do you deal with an infinite number of features. How do you even store an infinite number of things on the computer when your computer is gonna run out of memory. Unsupervised Learning The second major type of machine learning problem is called Unsupervised Learning. The difference between Unsupervised Learning and Supervised Learning is that in Supervised Learning we are told explicitly what is the so-called right answers (data are labeled). In Unsupervised Learning, we’re given data that doesn’t have any labels or that all has the same label or really no labels. Like in this example: So we’re given the data set and we’re not told what to do with it and we’re not told what each data point is. Instead we’re just told, here is a data set. Can you find some structure in the data? Given this data set, an Unsupervised Learning algorithm might decide that the data lives in two different clusters. This is called a clustering algorithm. Here are two examples where Unsupervised Learning or clustering is used. Social network analysis: So given knowledge about which friends you email the most or given your Facebook friends or your Google+ circles, can we automatically identify which are cohesive groups of friends, also which are groups of people that all know each other? Market segmentation: Many companies have huge databases of customer information. So, can you look at this customer data set and automatically discover market segments and automatically group your customers into different market segments so that you can automatically and more efficiently sell or market your different market segments together? This is Unsupervised Learning because we have all this customer data, but we don’t know in advance what are the market segments and for the customers in our data set, we don’t know in advance who is in market segment one, who is in market segment two, and so on. But we have to let the algorithm discover all this just from the data. ◼ "],

We will use \\(i\\) to index the samples or observations (from \\(1\\) tp \\(n\\)) and \\(j\\) will be used to index the variables (or features) (from \\(1\\) to \\(p\\)). We let \\(\\textbf{X}\\) denote a \\(n \\times p\\) matrix whose \\((i,j)\\)th element is \\(x_{ij}\\). That is, \\[ \\textbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{11} &amp; x_{12} &amp; x_{13} &amp; \\dots &amp; x_{1p} \\\\ x_{21} &amp; x_{22} &amp; x_{23} &amp; \\dots &amp; x_{2p} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_{n1} &amp; x_{n2} &amp; x_{n3} &amp; \\dots &amp; x_{np} \\end{pmatrix} \\] Note that it is useful to visualize \\(\\textbf{X}\\) as a spreadsheet of numbers with \\(n\\) rows and \\(p\\) columns. We will write the rows of \\(\\textbf{X}\\) as \\(x_1 , x_2 , \\ldots, x_n\\). Here \\(x_i\\) is a vector of length \\(p\\), containing the \\(p\\) variable measurements for the \\(i\\)th observation. That is, \\[ x_i = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{i1} \\\\ x_{i2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{ip} \\end{pmatrix}\\] (Vectors are by default represented as columns.) We will write the columns of \\(\\textbf{X}\\) as \\(\\textbf{x}_1 , \\textbf{x}_2, \\ldots, \\textbf{x}_p\\). Each is a vector of length \\(n\\). That is, \\[ \\textbf{x}_j = \\begin{pmatrix} \\textbf{x}_{1j} \\\\ \\textbf{x}_{2j} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\textbf{x}_{nj} \\end{pmatrix}\\] Using this notation, the matrix \\(\\textbf{X}\\) can be written as \\[ \\textbf{X} = (\\textbf{x}_1 \\textbf{x}_2 \\ldots \\textbf{x}_p) \\] or \\[ \\textbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{1}^T \\\\ x_{2}^T \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{n}^T \\end{pmatrix}\\] The \\(^T\\) notation denotes the transpose of a matrix or vector. We use \\(y_i\\) to denote the \\(i\\)th observation of the variable on which we wish to make predictions. We write the set of all \\(n\\) observations in vector form as \\[ \\textbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_{1}^T \\\\ y_{2}^T \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{n}^T \\end{pmatrix}\\] Then the observed data consists of \\(\\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2 , y_2 ), \\ldots , (x_n , y_n )\\}\\), where each \\(x_i\\) is a vector of length \\(p\\). (If \\(p = 1\\), then \\(x_i\\) is simply a scalar). 1.2 Model Representation Let’s consider the example about predicting housing prices. We’re going to use this data set as an example, Suppose that there is a person trying to sell a house of size 1250 square feet and he wants to know how much he might be able to sell the house for. One thing we could do is fit a model. Maybe fit a straight line to this data. Looks something like this, and based on that, maybe he can sell the house for around $220,000. Recall that this is an example of a supervised learning algorithm. And it’s supervised learning because we’re given the “right answer” for each of our examples. More precisely, this is an example of a regression problem where the term regression refers to the fact that we are predicting a real-valued output namely the price. More formally, in supervised learning, we have a data set and this data set is called a training set. So for housing prices example, we have a training set of different housing prices and our job is to learn from this data how to predict prices of the houses. Let’s define some notation from this data set: The size of the house is the input variable. The house price is the output variable. The input variables are typically denoted using the variable symbol \\(X\\), The inputs go by different names, such as predictors, independent variables, features, or sometimes just variables. The output variable is often called the response, dependent variable or target, and is typically denoted using the symbol \\(Y\\). \\((x_i,y_i)\\) is the \\(i\\)th training example. The set of \\(\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}\\) is the training set. \\(n\\) is the number of training examples. So here’s how this supervised learning algorithm works. Suppose that we observe a quantitative response \\(Y\\) and \\(p\\) different predictors, \\(X_1 , X_2 ,\\ldots, X_p\\) . We assume that there is some relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X = (X_1 , X_2 ,\\ldots, X_p)\\), which can be written in the very general form \\[Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\] Here \\(f\\) is some fixed but unknown function of \\(X_1 , X_2 ,\\ldots, X_p\\) , and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random error term, which is independent of \\(X\\) and has mean zero. The \\(f\\) function is also called hypothesis in Machine Learning. In general, the function \\(f\\) may involve more than one input variable. In essence, Supervised Learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating \\(f\\). 1.3 Why Estimate \\(f\\) ? There are two main reasons that we may wish to estimate \\(f\\): prediction and inference. Prediction In many situations, a set of inputs \\(X\\) are readily available, but the output \\(Y\\) cannot be easily obtained. In this setting, since the error term averages to zero, we can predict \\(Y\\) using \\[ \\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X) \\] where \\(\\hat{f}\\) represents our estimate for \\(f\\), and \\(\\hat{Y}\\) represents the resulting prediction for \\(Y\\). Like in the example above about predicting housing prices. We can measure the accuracy of \\(\\hat{Y}\\) by using a cost function. In the regression models, the most commonly-used measure is the mean squared error (MSE), given by \\[ MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{f}(x_i))^2\\] Inference We are often interested in understanding the way that \\(Y\\) is affected as \\(X_1 , X_2 ,\\ldots, X_p\\) change. In this situation we wish to estimate \\(f\\) , but our goal is not necessarily to make predictions for \\(Y\\). We instead want to understand the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), or more specifically, to understand how \\(Y\\) changes as a function of \\(X_1 , X_2 ,\\ldots, X_p\\). In this case, one may be interested in answering the following questions: Which predictors are associated with the response? What is the relationship between the response and each predictor? Can the relationship between Y and each predictor be adequately summarized using a linear equation, or is the relationship more complicated? 1.4 Simple Linear Regression Model Simple linear regression is a very straightforward approach for predicting a quantitative response \\(Y\\) on the basis of a single predictor variable \\(X\\). It assumes that there is approximately a linear relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Mathematically, we can write this linear relationship as \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon \\] \\[Y \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X\\] where \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are two unknown constants that represent the intercept and slope, also known as coefficients or parameters, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term. Given some estimates \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) for the model coefficients, we predict future inputs \\(x\\) using \\[\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} x\\] where \\(\\hat{y}\\) indicates a prediction of \\(Y\\) on the basis of \\(X = x\\). The hat symbol, \\(\\hat{}\\), denotes an estimated value. 1.5 Estimating the Coefficients Let \\(\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} x_i\\) be the prediction for \\(Y\\) based on the \\(i\\)th value of \\(X\\). Then \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\) represents the \\(i\\)th residual. We define the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)1 as \\[ \\begin{aligned} RSS &amp;= e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \\ldots + e_n^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2 \\end{aligned} \\] or equivantly as \\[ \\begin{aligned} RSS &amp;= (y_1 - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1} x_1)^2 + (y_2 - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1} x_2)^2 + \\ldots + (y_n - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1} x_n)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1} x_i)^2 \\end{aligned} \\] The least squares approach chooses \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) to minimize the RSS. The minimizing values can be shown to be2 \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\beta_1} &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) }{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 } = \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x^2} = (s_x^2)^{-1} s_{xy} \\\\ \\text{and} \\\\ \\hat{\\beta_0} &amp;= \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta_1} \\bar{x} \\end{aligned} \\] where: \\(\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i\\) is the sample mean. \\(s_x^2=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2\\) is the sample variance. The sample standard deviation is \\(s_x=\\sqrt{s_x^2}\\). \\(s_{xy}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})\\) is the sample covariance. It measures the degree of linear association between \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) and \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\). Once scaled by \\(s_xs_y\\), it gives the sample correlation coefficient, \\(r_{xy}=\\frac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y}\\). 1- To find the optimal estimates for β0 and β1 we need a choice-criterion. In the case of the least squares approach (more precisely, the ordinary least squares OLS) this criterion is the residual sum of squares RSS: we calculate β0 and β1 that minimise the RSS. 2- Minimizing the RSS function requires to calculate the first order derivatives with respect to β0 and β1 and set them to zero. 3- Click here and watch the video to understand more about the residuals and least squares. 4- Click here to see the influence of the distance employed in the sum of squares. Try to minimize the sum of squares for the different datasets. The choices of intercept and slope that minimize the sum of squared distances for a kind of distance are not the optimal for a different kind of distance. 1.6 Assessing the Accuracy of the Coefficient Estimates The standard error of an estimator reflects how it varies under repeated sampling. We have \\[ \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\] \\[ \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_0})^2 = \\sigma^2 \\bigg[ \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\bigg] \\] where \\(\\sigma^2 = Var(\\epsilon)\\) In general, \\(\\sigma^2\\) is unknown, but can be estimated from the data. The estimate of \\(\\sigma\\) is known as the residual standard error, and is given by \\[ \\text{RSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{RSS}}{(n-2)}} \\] These standard errors can be used to compute confidence intervals. A \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval is defined as a range of values such that with \\(95\\%\\) probability, the range will contain the true unknown value of the parameter. It has the form \\[ \\hat{\\beta_1} \\pm 2 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}) \\] That is, there is approximately a \\(95\\%\\) chance that the interval \\[ \\bigg[ \\hat{\\beta_1} - 2 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}), \\hat{\\beta_1} + 2 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}) \\bigg] \\] will contain the true value of \\(\\beta_1\\). Similarly, a confidence interval for \\(\\beta_0\\) approximately takes the form \\[ \\hat{\\beta_0} \\pm 2 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_0}) \\] Hypothesis testing Standard errors can also be used to perform hypothesis tests on the coefficients. The most common hypothesis test involves testing the null hypothesis of \\[ H_0 : \\text{There is no relationship between} \\, X \\, \\text{and} \\, Y \\] versus the alternative hypothesis \\[ H_1 : \\text{There is some relationship between} \\, X \\, \\text{and} \\, Y \\] Mathematically, this corresponds to testing \\[ H_0 : \\beta_1 = 0 \\] versus \\[ H_1 : \\beta_1 \\neq 0 \\] since if \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\) then the simple linear regression model reduces to \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon\\), and \\(X\\) is not associated with \\(Y\\). To test the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), we compute a t-statistic, given by \\[ t = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_1} - 0}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})} \\] This will have a \\(t\\)-distribution (Student) with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom, assuming \\(\\beta_1=0\\). Using statistical software, it is easy to compute the probability of observing any value equal to \\(|t|\\) or larger. We call this probability the p-value. If p-value is small enough (typically under \\(0.01\\) (\\(1\\%\\) error) or \\(0.05\\) (\\(5\\%\\) error)) we reject the null hypothesis, that is we declare a relationship to exist between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). 1.7 ANOVA and model fit 1.7.1 ANOVA In this section we will see how the variance of \\(Y\\) is decomposed into two parts, each one corresponding to the regression and to the error, respectively. This decomposition is called the ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA). Before explaining ANOVA, it is important to recall an interesting result: the mean of the fitted values \\(\\hat Y_1,\\ldots,\\hat Y_n\\) is the mean of \\(Y_1,\\ldots, Y_n\\). This is easily seen if we plug-in the expression of \\(\\hat\\beta_0\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat Y_i=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\hat \\beta_0+\\hat\\beta_1X_i\\right)=\\hat \\beta_0+\\hat\\beta_1\\bar X=\\left(\\bar Y - \\hat\\beta_1\\bar X \\right) + \\hat\\beta_1\\bar X=\\bar Y. \\end{align*}\\] The ANOVA decomposition considers the following measures of variation related with the response: \\(\\text{SST}=\\text{TSS}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(Y_i-\\bar Y\\right)^2\\), the Total Sum of Squares. This is the total variation of \\(Y_1,\\ldots,Y_n\\), since \\(\\text{SST}=ns_y^2\\), where \\(s_y^2\\) is the sample variance of \\(Y_1,\\ldots,Y_n\\). \\(\\text{SSR}=\\text{ESS}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\hat Y_i-\\bar Y\\right)^2\\), the Regression Sum of Squares or Explained Sum of Squares3. This is the variation explained by the regression line, that is, the variation from \\(\\bar Y\\) that is explained by the estimated conditional mean \\(\\hat Y_i=\\hat\\beta_0+\\hat\\beta_1X_i\\). \\(\\text{SSR}=ns_{\\hat y}^2\\), where \\(s_{\\hat y}^2\\) is the sample variance of \\(\\hat Y_1,\\ldots,\\hat Y_n\\). \\(\\text{SSE}=\\text{RSS}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(Y_i-\\hat Y_i\\right)^2\\), the Sum of Squared Errors or Residual Sum of Squares4. Is the variation around the conditional mean. Recall that \\(\\text{SSE}=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat\\varepsilon_i^2=(n-2)\\hat\\sigma^2\\), where \\(\\hat\\sigma^2\\) is the sample variance of \\(\\hat \\varepsilon_1,\\ldots,\\hat \\varepsilon_n\\). The ANOVA decomposition is \\[\\begin{align*} \\underbrace{\\text{SST}}_{\\text{Variation of }Y_i&#39;s} = \\underbrace{\\text{SSR}}_{\\text{Variation of }\\hat Y_i&#39;s} + \\underbrace{\\text{SSE}}_{\\text{Variation of }\\hat \\varepsilon_i&#39;s} \\end{align*}\\] The graphical interpretation of this equation is shown in the following figures. Figure 1.1: Visualization of the ANOVA decomposition. SST measures the variation of \\(Y_1,\\ldots,Y_n\\) with respect to \\(\\bar Y\\). SST measures the variation with respect to the conditional means, \\(\\hat \\beta_0+\\hat\\beta_1X_i\\). SSE collects the variation of the residuals.

The next time the animation will show up correctly. The ANOVA table summarizes the decomposition of the variance. Here is given in the layout employed by R. Degrees of freedom Sum Squares Mean Squares \\(F\\)-value \\(p\\)-value Predictor \\(1\\) \\(\\text{SSR}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\hat Y_i-\\bar Y\\right)^2\\) \\(\\text{MSR}=\\frac{\\text{SSR}}{1}\\) \\(\\frac{\\text{SSR}/1}{\\text{SSE}/(n-2)}\\) \\(p\\) Residuals \\(n - 2\\) \\(\\text{SSE}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(Y_i-\\hat Y_i\\right)^2\\) \\(\\text{MSE}=\\frac{\\text{SSE}}{n-2}\\) Total \\(n-1\\) \\(\\text{SST}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(Y_i-\\bar Y\\right)^2\\) The anova function in R takes a model as an input and returns the ANOVA table. The “\\(F\\)-value” of the ANOVA table represents the value of the \\(F\\)-statistic \\(\\frac{\\text{SSR}/1}{\\text{SSE}/(n-2)}\\). This statistic is employed to test \\[\\begin{align*} H_0:\\beta_1=0\\quad\\text{vs.}\\quad H_1:\\beta_1\\neq 0, \\end{align*}\\] that is, the hypothesis of no linear dependence of \\(Y\\) on \\(X\\). The result of this test is completely equivalent to the \\(t\\)-test for \\(\\beta_1\\) that we saw previously in the Hypothesis testing (this is something specific for simple linear regression – the \\(F\\)-test will not be equivalent to the \\(t\\)-test for \\(\\beta_1\\) in the Mulitple Linear Regression). It happens that \\[\\begin{align*} F=\\frac{\\text{SSR}/1}{\\text{SSE}/(n-2)}\\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} F_{1,n-2}, \\end{align*}\\] where \\(F_{1,n-2}\\) is the Snedecor’s \\(F\\) distribution5 with \\(1\\) and \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom. If \\(H_0\\) is true, then \\(F\\) is expected to be small since SSR will be close to zero. The \\(p\\)-value of this test is the same as the \\(p\\)-value of the \\(t\\)-test for \\(H_0:\\beta_1=0\\). 1.7.2 The \\(R^2\\) Statistic To calculate \\(R^2\\), we use the formula \\[ R^2 = \\frac{\\text{TSS} - \\text{RSS}}{\\text{TSS}} = 1- \\frac{\\text{RSS}}{\\text{TSS}} \\] where \\(\\text{TSS} = \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\\) is the total sum of squares. \\(R^2\\) measures the proportion of variability in \\(Y\\) that can be explained using \\(X\\). An \\(R^2\\) statistic that is close to 1 indicates that a large proportion of the variability in the response has been explained by the regression. A number near 0 indicates that the regression did not explain much of the variability in the response; this might occur because the linear model is wrong, or the inherent error \\(\\sigma^2\\) is high, or both. It can be shown that in this simple linear linear regression setting that \\(R^2 = r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\): \\[ r = \\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} \\] R2 does not measure the correctness of a linear model but its usefulness (for prediction, for explaining the variance of Y), assuming the model is correct. Trusting blindly the R2 can lead to catastrophic conclusions, since the model may not be correct. So remember: A large R2 means nothing if the assumptions of the model do not hold.

["pw-1.html", "PW 1 1.8 Some R basics 1.9 Regression", " PW 1 1.8 Some R basics 1.8.1 Basic Commands R uses functions to perform operations. To run a function called funcname,we type funcname(input1, input2) , where the inputs (or arguments) input1 and input2 tell R how to run the function. A function can have any number of inputs. For example, to create a vector of numbers, we use the function c() (for concatenate). x &lt;- c(1,3,2,5) x #ans&gt; [1] 1 3 2 5 Note that the &gt; is not part of the command; rather, it is printed by R to indicate that it is ready for another command to be entered. We can also save things using = rather than &lt;-. Note that the answer in the code above is followed by #ans&gt; while in the R console it is not. x = c(1,6,2) x #ans&gt; [1] 1 6 2 y = c(1,4,3) length(x) #ans&gt; [1] 3 length(y) #ans&gt; [1] 3 x+y #ans&gt; [1] 2 10 5 Hitting the up arrow multiple times will display the previous commands, which can then be edited. This is useful since one often wishes to repeat a similar command. The ls() function allows us to look at a list of all of the objects, such ls() as data and functions, that we have saved so far. The rm() function can be used to delete any object that we don’t want. ls() #ans&gt; [1] &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; rm(x) ls() #ans&gt; [1] &quot;y&quot; 1.8.2 Vectors # A handy way of creating sequences is the operator : # Sequence from 1 to 5 1:5 #ans&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 # Storing some vectors vec &lt;- c(-4.12, 0, 1.1, 1, 3, 4) vec #ans&gt; [1] -4.12 0.00 1.10 1.00 3.00 4.00 # Entry-wise operations vec + 1 #ans&gt; [1] -3.12 1.00 2.10 2.00 4.00 5.00 vec^2 #ans&gt; [1] 16.97 0.00 1.21 1.00 9.00 16.00 # If you want to access a position of a vector, use [position] vec[6] #ans&gt; [1] 4 # You also can change elements vec[2] &lt;- -1 vec #ans&gt; [1] -4.12 -1.00 1.10 1.00 3.00 4.00 # If you want to access all the elements except a position, use [-position] vec[-2] #ans&gt; [1] -4.12 1.10 1.00 3.00 4.00 # Also with vectors as indexes vec[1:2] #ans&gt; [1] -4.12 -1.00 # And also vec[-c(1, 2)] #ans&gt; [1] 1.1 1.0 3.0 4.0 Do the following: Create the vector x = (1, 7, 3, 4).

For instance, plot(x,y) produces a scatterplot of the numbers in x versus the numbers in y. There are many additional options that can be passed in to the plot() function. For example, passing in the argument xlab will result in a label on the x-axis. To find out more information about the plot() function, type ?plot. x=rnorm(100) # The rnorm() function generates a vector of random normal variables, # rnorm() with first argument n the sample size. Each time we call this # function, we will get a different answer. y=rnorm(100) plot(x,y) # with titles plot(x,y,xlab=&quot;this is the x-axis&quot;,ylab=&quot;this is the y-axis&quot;, main=&quot;Plot of X vs Y&quot;) 1.8.5 Distributions # R allows to sample [r], compute density/probability mass [d], # compute distribution function [p] and compute quantiles [q] for several # continuous and discrete distributions.

Add lines of different colors with the densities for df = 5, df = 10, df = 50 and df = 100. 1.8.6 Working directory Your working directory is the folder on your computer in which you are currently working. When you ask R to open a certain file, it will look in the working directory for this file, and when you tell R to save a data file or figure, it will save it in the working directory. To set your working directory within RStudio you can go to Tools / Set working directory, or use the command setwd(), we put the complete path of the directory between the brackets, do not forget to put the path into quotation marks &quot;&quot;. To know the actual working directory we use getwd(). 1.8.7 Loading Data The read.table() function is one of the primary ways to import a data set into R. The help file ?read.table() contains details about how to use this function. We can use the function write.table() to export data. Next we will show how to load the data set Auto.data (Download it from here ). Auto=read.table(&quot;Auto.data&quot;,header=T,na.strings =&quot;?&quot;) # For this file we needed to tell R that the first row is the # names of the variables. # na.strings tells R that any time it sees a particular character # or set of characters (such as a question mark), it should be # treated as a missing element of the data matrix. If the file is of csv format, we use read.csv. Always try to look to the file before importing it to R (Open it in a text editor. See for example if the first row containes the variables names, if the columns are separated by , or ; or .. For text editors, I suggest Sublime Text or Atom. dim(Auto) # To see the dimensions of the data set #ans&gt; [1] 397 9 nrow(Auto) # To see the number of rows #ans&gt; [1] 397 ncol(Auto) # To see the number of columns #ans&gt; [1] 9 Auto[1:4,] # The first 4 rows of the data set #ans&gt; mpg cylinders displacement horsepower weight acceleration year origin #ans&gt; 1 18 8 307 130 3504 12.0 70 1 #ans&gt; 2 15 8 350 165 3693 11.5 70 1 #ans&gt; 3 18 8 318 150 3436 11.0 70 1 #ans&gt; 4 16 8 304 150 3433 12.0 70 1 #ans&gt; name #ans&gt; 1 chevrolet chevelle malibu #ans&gt; 2 buick skylark 320 #ans&gt; 3 plymouth satellite #ans&gt; 4 amc rebel sst # Once the data are loaded correctly, we can use names() # to check the variable names. names(Auto) #ans&gt; [1] &quot;mpg&quot; &quot;cylinders&quot; &quot;displacement&quot; &quot;horsepower&quot; #ans&gt; [5] &quot;weight&quot; &quot;acceleration&quot; &quot;year&quot; &quot;origin&quot; #ans&gt; [9] &quot;name&quot; Take a look at this (very) short introduction to R. It can be useful. 1.9 Regression 1.9.1 The lm function We are going to employ the EU dataset. The EU dataset contains 28 rows with the member states of the European Union (Country), the number of seats assigned under different years (Seats2011, Seats2014), the Cambridge Compromise apportionment (CamCom2011), and the countries population (Population2010,Population2013). Click here to download the EU dataset. # Load the dataset, when we load an .RData using load() # function we do not attribute it to a name like we did # when we used read.table() or when we use read.csv() load(&quot;EU.RData&quot;) There is two ways to tell R where is the file you want to load/use/import or where to save a file when you write/export/save : write the complete path of the files. set a working directory and put the files in it. # lm (for linear model) has the syntax: # lm(formula = response ~ predictor, data = data) # The response is the y in the model. The predictor is x. # For example (after loading the EU dataset) mod &lt;- lm(formula = Seats2011 ~ Population2010, data = EU) # We have saved the linear model into mod, which now contains all the output of lm # You can see it by typing mod #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Call: #ans&gt; lm(formula = Seats2011 ~ Population2010, data = EU) #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Coefficients: #ans&gt; (Intercept) Population2010 #ans&gt; 7.91e+00 1.08e-06 # mod is indeed a list of objects whose names are names(mod) #ans&gt; [1] &quot;coefficients&quot; &quot;residuals&quot; &quot;effects&quot; &quot;rank&quot; #ans&gt; [5] &quot;fitted.values&quot; &quot;assign&quot; &quot;qr&quot; &quot;df.residual&quot; #ans&gt; [9] &quot;na.action&quot; &quot;xlevels&quot; &quot;call&quot; &quot;terms&quot; #ans&gt; [13] &quot;model&quot; # We can access these elements by $ # For example mod$coefficients #ans&gt; (Intercept) Population2010 #ans&gt; 7.91e+00 1.08e-06 # The residuals mod$residuals #ans&gt; Germany France United Kingdom Italy Spain #ans&gt; 2.8675 -3.7031 -1.7847 0.0139 -3.5084 #ans&gt; Poland Romania Netherlands Greece Belgium #ans&gt; 1.9272 1.9434 0.2142 1.8977 2.3994 #ans&gt; Portugal Czech Republic Hungary Sweden Austria #ans&gt; 2.6175 2.7587 3.2898 2.0163 2.0575 #ans&gt; Bulgaria Denmark Slovakia Finland Ireland #ans&gt; 1.9328 -0.8790 -0.7606 -0.6813 -0.7284 #ans&gt; Lithuania Latvia Slovenia Estonia Cyprus #ans&gt; 0.4998 -1.3347 -2.1175 -3.3552 -2.7761 #ans&gt; Luxembourg Malta #ans&gt; -2.4514 -2.3553 # The fitted values mod$fitted.values #ans&gt; Germany France United Kingdom Italy Spain #ans&gt; 96.13 77.70 74.78 72.99 57.51 #ans&gt; Poland Romania Netherlands Greece Belgium #ans&gt; 49.07 31.06 25.79 20.10 19.60 #ans&gt; Portugal Czech Republic Hungary Sweden Austria #ans&gt; 19.38 19.24 18.71 17.98 16.94 #ans&gt; Bulgaria Denmark Slovakia Finland Ireland #ans&gt; 16.07 13.88 13.76 13.68 12.73 #ans&gt; Lithuania Latvia Slovenia Estonia Cyprus #ans&gt; 11.50 10.33 10.12 9.36 8.78 #ans&gt; Luxembourg Malta #ans&gt; 8.45 8.36 # Summary of the model sumMod &lt;- summary(mod) sumMod #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Call: #ans&gt; lm(formula = Seats2011 ~ Population2010, data = EU) #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Residuals: #ans&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #ans&gt; -3.703 -1.951 0.014 1.980 3.290 #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Coefficients: #ans&gt; Estimate Std.

Access the object sigma of myModel. 1.9.2 Predicting House Value: Boston dataset We are going to use a dataset called Boston which is part of the MASS package. It recordes the median value of houses for 506 neighborhoods around Boston. Our task is to predict the median house value (medv) using only one predictor (lstat: percent of households with low socioeconomic status). # First, install the MASS package using the command: install.packages(&quot;MASS&quot;) # load MASS package library(MASS) # Check the dimensions of the Boston dataset dim(Boston) #ans&gt; [1] 506 14 STEP 1: Split the dataset # Split the data by using the first 400 observations as the training # data and the remaining as the testing data train = 1:400 test = -train # Speficy that we are going to use only two variables (lstat and medv) variables = which(names(Boston) ==c(&quot;lstat&quot;, &quot;medv&quot;)) training_data = Boston[train, variables] testing_data = Boston[test, variables] # Check the dimensions of the new dataset dim(training_data) #ans&gt; [1] 400 2 STEP 2: Check for Linearity In order to perfom linear regression in R, we will use the function lm()to fit a simple linear regression with medv as the response (dependent variable) and lstat as the predictor or independent variable, and then save it in model. But before we run our model, let’s visually check if the relationship between x and y is linear. # Scatterplot of lstat vs. medv plot(training_data$lstat, training_data$medv) On the figure above, modify the following: Figure title. Axis titles. Shape of observations and their colors. Sizes of the chosen shape. According to the plot, we see that the relationship is not linear. Let’s try a transformation of our explanatory variable lstat. # Scatterplot of log(lstat) vs. medv plot(log(training_data$lstat), training_data$medv) Look at the plot, it is more linear, so we can proceed and perform lm(): STEP 3: Run the linear regression model model = lm(medv ~ log(lstat), data = training_data) model #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Call: #ans&gt; lm(formula = medv ~ log(lstat), data = training_data) #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Coefficients: #ans&gt; (Intercept) log(lstat) #ans&gt; 51.8 -12.2 Notice that basic information when we print model. This only give us the slope \\((-12.2)\\) and the intercept \\((51.8)\\) of the linear model. Note that here we are looking at log(lstat) and not lstat anymore. So for every one unit increase in lstat, the median value of the house will decrease by \\(e^{12.2}\\). For more detailed information, we can use the summary() function: summary(model) #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Call: #ans&gt; lm(formula = medv ~ log(lstat), data = training_data) #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Residuals: #ans&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #ans&gt; -11.385 -3.908 -0.779 2.245 25.728 #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Coefficients: #ans&gt; Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) #ans&gt; (Intercept) 51.783 1.097 47.2 &lt;2e-16 *** #ans&gt; log(lstat) -12.203 0.472 -25.9 &lt;2e-16 *** #ans&gt; --- #ans&gt; Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Residual standard error: 5.6 on 398 degrees of freedom #ans&gt; Multiple R-squared: 0.627, Adjusted R-squared: 0.626 #ans&gt; F-statistic: 669 on 1 and 398 DF, p-value: &lt;2e-16 Now, we have access to p-values and standard errors for the coefficients, as well as the \\(R^2\\). The output states that the slope is statistically significant and different from \\(0\\) and with a t-value= \\(-25.9\\) (p-value \\(&lt; 0.05\\)), which means that there is a significant relationship between the percentage of households with low socioeconomic income and the median house value. This relationship is negative. That is as the percantage of household with low socioeconomic income increases, the median house value decreases. Looking at \\(R^2\\), we can deduce that \\(62.7\\%\\) of the model variation is being explained by the predictor log(lstat). This is probably low, but indeed it would increase if we had more independent (explanatory) variables. We can use the names() function to see what other pieces of information are stored in our linear model (model). names(model) #ans&gt; [1] &quot;coefficients&quot; &quot;residuals&quot; &quot;effects&quot; &quot;rank&quot; #ans&gt; [5] &quot;fitted.values&quot; &quot;assign&quot; &quot;qr&quot; &quot;df.residual&quot; #ans&gt; [9] &quot;xlevels&quot; &quot;call&quot; &quot;terms&quot; &quot;model&quot; model$coefficients #ans&gt; (Intercept) log(lstat) #ans&gt; 51.8 -12.2 To obtain the confidence intervel for the linear model (model), we can use the confint() function: confint(model, level = 0.95) #ans&gt; 2.5 % 97.5 % #ans&gt; (Intercept) 49.6 53.9 #ans&gt; log(lstat) -13.1 -11.3 So, a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for the slope of log(lstat) is \\((-13.13, -11.28)\\). Notice that this confidence interval gives us the same result as the hypothesis test performed earlier, by stating that we are \\(95\\%\\) confident that the slope of lstat is not zero (in fact it is less than zero, which means that the relationship is negative.) STEP 4: Plot the regression model Now, let’s plot our regression line on top of our data. # Scatterplot of lstat vs. medv plot(log(training_data$lstat), training_data$medv) # Add the regression line to the existing scatterplot abline(model) Let’s play with the look of the plot, and makes it perttier! # Scatterplot of lstat vs. medv plot(log(training_data$lstat), training_data$medv, xlab = &quot;Log Transform of % of Houshold with Low Socioeconomic Income&quot;, ylab = &quot;Median House Value&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 20) # Make the line color blue, and the line&#39;s width =3 (play with the width!) abline(model, col = &quot;blue&quot;, lwd =3) STEP 5: Assess the model Final thing we will do is to predict using our fitted model.

["multiple-linear-regression.html", "2 Multiple Linear Regression 2.1 The Model 2.2 Estimating the Regression Coefficients 2.3 Some important questions 2.4 How to select the best performing model", " 2 Multiple Linear Regression Simple linear regression is a useful approach for predicting a response on the basis of a single predictor variable. However, in practice we often have more than one predictor. In the previous chapter, we took for example the prediction of housing prices considering we had the size of each house. We had a single feature \\(X\\), the size of the house. But now imagine if we had not only the size of the house as a feature but we also knew the number of bedrooms, the number of flours and the age of the house in years. It seems like this would give us a lot more information with which to predict the price. 2.1 The Model In general, suppose that we have \\(p\\) distinct predictors. Then the multiple linear regression model takes the form \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p + \\epsilon \\] where \\(X_j\\) represents the \\(j\\)th predictor and \\(\\beta_j\\) quantifies the association between that variable and the response. We interpret \\(\\beta_j\\) as the average effect on \\(Y\\) of a one unit increase in \\(X_j\\), holding all other predictors fixed. In matrix terms, supposing we have \\(n\\) observations and \\(p\\) variables, we need to define the following matrices: \\[\\begin{equation} \\textbf{Y}_{n \\times 1} = \\begin{pmatrix} Y_{1} \\\\ Y_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_{n} \\end{pmatrix} \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\textbf{X}_{n \\times (p+1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; X_{11} &amp; X_{12} &amp; \\dots &amp; X_{1p} \\\\ 1 &amp; X_{21} &amp; X_{22} &amp; \\dots &amp; X_{2p} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; X_{n1} &amp; X_{n2} &amp; \\dots &amp; X_{np} \\end{pmatrix} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} {\\mathbb{\\beta}}_{(p+1) \\times 1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_{0} \\\\ \\beta_{1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_{p} \\end{pmatrix} \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, {\\epsilon}_{n \\times 1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{1} \\\\ \\epsilon_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_{n} \\end{pmatrix} \\end{equation}\\] In matrix terms, the general linear regression model is \\[ \\textbf{Y}_{n \\times 1} = \\textbf{X}_{n \\times (p+1)} {\\mathbb{\\beta}}_{(p+1) \\times 1} + {\\epsilon}_{n \\times 1} \\] where, \\(\\textbf{Y}\\) is a vector of responses. \\(\\mathbb{\\beta}\\) is a vector of parameters. \\(\\textbf{X}\\) is a matrix of constants. \\(\\epsilon\\) is a vector of independent normal (Gaussian) random variables. 2.2 Estimating the Regression Coefficients As was the case in the simple linear regression setting, the regression coefficients \\(\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}, \\ldots, \\beta_{p}\\) are unknown, and must be estimated. Given estimates \\(\\hat{\\beta_{0}}, \\hat{\\beta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\hat{\\beta_{p}}\\), we can make predictions using the formula \\[ \\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_{0}} + \\hat{\\beta_{1}} x_1 + \\hat{\\beta_{2}} x_2 + \\ldots, \\hat{\\beta_{p}} x_p \\] We choose \\(\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}, \\ldots, \\beta_{p}\\) to minimize the residual sum of squares \\[ \\begin{aligned} RSS &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_1 - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1} \\hat{x}_{i1} - \\hat{\\beta_2} \\hat{x}_{i2} - \\ldots - \\hat{\\beta_p} \\hat{x}_{ip})^2 \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] The values \\(\\hat{\\beta_{0}}, \\hat{\\beta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\hat{\\beta_{p}}\\) that minimize the RSS are the multiple least squares regression coefficient estimates, they are calculated using this formula (in matrix terms): \\[ \\hat{\\beta} = (\\textbf{X}^T \\textbf{X})^{-1}\\textbf{X}^T \\textbf{Y} \\] To obtain \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\), we can write the residual sum of squares as \\[ RSS = (\\textbf{Y}-\\textbf{X}\\beta)^T(\\textbf{Y}-\\textbf{X}\\beta) \\] This is a quadratic function in the \\(p+1\\) parameters. Differentiating with respect to \\(\\beta\\) we obtain \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial RSS}{\\partial \\beta} &amp;= -2\\textbf{X}^T(\\textbf{Y}-\\textbf{X}\\beta) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 RSS}{\\partial \\beta \\partial \\beta^T} &amp;= 2\\textbf{X}^T\\textbf{X}.\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Assuming (for the moment) that \\(\\textbf{X}\\) has full column rank, and hence \\(\\textbf{X}^T\\textbf{X}\\) is positive definite6, we set the first derivative to zero \\[\\textbf{X}^T(\\textbf{Y}-\\textbf{X}\\beta)=0\\] to obtain the unique solution \\[ \\hat{\\beta} = (\\textbf{X}^T \\textbf{X})^{-1}\\textbf{X}^T \\textbf{Y} \\] Note 1: It is a remarkable property of matrix algebra that the results for the general linear regression model in matrix notation appear exactly as those for the simple linear regression model. Only the degrees of freedom and other constants related to the number of X variables and the dimensions of some matrices are different. Which means there are some similarities between \\(\\hat{\\beta} = (\\textbf{X}^T \\textbf{X})^{-1}\\textbf{X}^T \\textbf{Y}\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta_1=(s_x^2)^{-1}s_{xy}\\) from the simple linear model: both are related to the covariance between X and Y weighted by the variance of X. Note 2: If XTX is noninvertible, the common causes might be having: Redundant features, where two features are very closely related (i.e. they are linearly dependent) Too many features (e.g. p ≥ n). In this case, we delete some features or we use “regularization” (to be, maybe, explained in a later lesson). 2.3 Some important questions When we perform multiple linear regression, we usually are interested in answering a few important questions. Is at least one of the predictors \\(X_1 ,X_2 ,\\ldots,X_p\\) useful in predicting the response? Do all the predictors help to explain \\(Y\\), or is only a subset of the predictors useful? How well does the model fit the data? Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict, and how accurate is our prediction? Relationship Between the Response and Predictors? \\(F\\)-Statistic Recall that in the simple linear regression setting, in order to determine whether there is a relationship between the response and the predictor we can simply check whether \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\). In the multiple regression setting with \\(p\\) predictors, we need to ask whether all of the regression coefficients are zero, i.e. whether \\(\\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\ldots = \\beta_p = 0\\). As in the simple linear regression setting, we use a hypothesis test to answer this question. We test the null hypothesis, \\[ H_0 : \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\ldots = \\beta_p = 0 \\] versus the alternative hypothesis \\[ H_1 : \\text{at least one} \\, \\beta_j \\, \\text{is non-zero} \\] This hypothesis test is performed by computing the \\(F\\)-statistic (Fisher): \\[ F = \\frac{ (\\text{TSS} - \\text{RSS})/p}{\\text{RSS}/(n-p-1)} \\sim F_{p,n-p-1} \\] where, as with simple linear regression, \\(\\text{TSS} = \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\\) and \\(\\text{RSS} = \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\\). Note that \\(F_{p,n-p-1}\\) represents the Fisher-Snedecor’s \\(F\\) distribution with \\(p\\) and \\(n-p-1\\) degrees of freedom. If \\(H_0\\) is true, then \\(F\\) is expected to be small since ESS7 will be close to zero (little variation is explained by the regression model since \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\approx\\mathbf{0}\\)). So the question we ask here: Is the whole regression explaining anything at all? The answer comes from the \\(F\\)-test in the ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) table. This is what we get in an ANOVA table: Source df SS MS \\(F\\) p-value Factor (Explained) \\(p\\) ESS=SSR MSR=ESS/\\((p)\\) F=MSR/MSE p-value Error (Unexplained) \\(n-p-1\\) RSS=SSE MSE=RSS/\\((n-p-1)\\) Total \\(n-1\\) SST=TSS The ANOVA table has many pieces of information. What we care about is the \\(F\\) Ratio and the corresponding p-value. We compare the \\(F\\) Ratio with \\(F_{(p,n-p-1)}\\) and a corresponding \\(\\alpha\\) value (error). The “ANOVA table” is a broad concept in statistics, with different variants. Here we are only covering the basic ANOVA table from the relation SST = SSR + SSE. However, further sophistications are possible when SSR is decomposed into the variations contributed by each predictor. In particular, for multiple linear regression R’s anova implements a sequential (type I) ANOVA table, which is not the previous table! The anova function in R takes a model as an input and returns the following sequential ANOVA table8: Degrees of freedom Sum Squares Mean Squares \\(F\\)-value \\(p\\)-value Predictor 1 \\(1\\) ESS\\(_1\\) \\(\\frac{\\text{ESS}_1}{1}\\) \\(\\frac{\\text{ESS}_1/1}{\\text{RSS}/(n-p-1)}\\) \\(p_1\\) Predictor 2 \\(1\\) ESS\\(_2\\) \\(\\frac{\\text{ESS}_2}{1}\\) \\(\\frac{\\text{ESS}_2/1}{\\text{RSS}/(n-p-1)}\\) \\(p_2\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) Predictor \\(p\\) \\(1\\) ESS\\(_p\\) \\(\\frac{\\text{ESS}_p}{1}\\) \\(\\frac{\\text{ESS}_p/1}{\\text{RSS}/(n-p-1)}\\) \\(p_p\\) Residuals \\(n - p - 1\\) RSS \\(\\frac{\\text{RSS}}{n-p-1}\\) Here the ESS\\(_j\\) represents the explained sum of squares (same as regression sum of squares) associated to the inclusion of \\(X_j\\) in the model with predictors \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_{j-1}\\), this is: \\[ \\text{ESS}_j=\\text{ESS}(X_1,\\ldots,X_j)-\\text{ESS}(X_1,\\ldots,X_{j-1}). \\] The \\(p\\)-values \\(p_1,\\ldots,p_p\\) correspond to the testing of the hypotheses \\[\\begin{align*} H_0:\\beta_j=0\\quad\\text{vs.}\\quad H_1:\\beta_j\\neq 0, \\end{align*}\\] carried out inside the linear model \\(Y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_1+\\ldots+\\beta_jX_j+\\varepsilon\\). This is like the \\(t\\)-test for \\(\\beta_j\\) for the model with predictors \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_j\\). Recall that there is no \\(F\\)-test in this version of the ANOVA table. p-values The p-values provide information about whether each individual predictor is related to the response, after adjusting for the other predictors. Let’s look at the following table we obtain in general using a statistical software for example Coefficient Std. error \\(t\\)-statistic p-value Constant 2.939 0.3119 9.42 &lt;0.0001 \\(X_1\\) 0.046 0.0014 32.81 &lt;0.0001 \\(X_2\\) 0.189 0.0086 21.89 &lt;0.0001 \\(X_3\\) -0.001 0.0059 -0.18 0.8599 In this table we have the following model \\[ Y = 2.939 + 0.046 X_1 + 0.189 X_2 - 0.001 X_3 \\] Note that for each individual predictor a \\(t\\)-statistic and a p-value were reported. These p-values indicate that \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are related to \\(Y\\), but that there is no evidence that \\(X_3\\) is associated with \\(Y\\), in the presence of these two. Deciding on Important Variables The most direct approach is called all subsets or best subsets regression: we compute the least squares fit for all possible subsets and then choose between them based on some criterion that balances training error with model size. However we often can’t examine all possible models, since they are \\(2^p\\) of them; for example when \\(p = 40\\) there are over a billion models! Instead we need an automated approach that searches through a subset of them. Here are two commonly use approaches: Forward selection: Begin with the null model — a model that contains an intercept (constant) but no predictors. Fit \\(p\\) simple linear regressions and add to the null model the variable that results in the lowest RSS. Add to that model the variable that results in the lowest RSS amongst all two-variable models. Continue until some stopping rule is satisfied, for example when all remaining variables have a p-value above some threshold. Backward selection: Start with all variables in the model. Remove the variable with the largest p-value — that is, the variable that is the least statistically significant. The new \\((p − 1)\\)-variable model is fit, and the variable with the largest p-value is removed. Continue until a stopping rule is reached. For instance, we may stop when all remaining variables have a significant p-value defined by some significance threshold. There are more systematic criteria for choosing an “optimal” member in the path of models produced by forward or backward stepwise selection. These include Mallow’s Cp , Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), adjusted R2 and Cross-validation (CV). Model Fit Two of the most common numerical measures of model fit are the RSE and \\(R^2\\), the fraction of variance explained. These quantities are computed and interpreted in the same fashion as for simple linear regression. Recall that in simple regression, \\(R^2\\) is the square of the correlation of the response and the variable. In multiple linear regression, it turns out that it equals \\(Cor(Y, \\hat{Y})^2\\) , the square of the correlation between the response and the fitted linear model; in fact one property of the fitted linear model is that it maximizes this correlation among all possible linear models. An \\(R^2\\) value close to 1 indicates that the model explains a large portion of the variance in the response variable. In general RSE is defined as \\[ \\text{RSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-p-1}\\text{RSS}} \\] 2.3.1 Other Considerations in Regression Model Qualitative Predictors If we have a categorial (qualitative) variable (feature), how do we fit into a regression equation? For example, if \\(X_1\\) is the gender (male or female). We can code, for example, male = 0 and female = 1. Suppose \\(X_2\\) is a quantitative variable, the regression equation becomes: \\[ Y_i \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 = \\begin{cases} \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 X_2 &amp; \\text{ if male} \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 &amp; \\text{ if female} \\end{cases} \\] Another possible coding scheme is to let male = -1 and female = 1, the regression equation is then: \\[ Y_i \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 = \\begin{cases} \\beta_0 -\\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 &amp; \\text{ if male} \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 &amp; \\text{ if female} \\end{cases} \\] Interaction Terms When the effect on \\(Y\\) of increasing \\(X_1\\) depends on another \\(X_2\\). We may in this case try the model \\[ Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 X_1 X_2 \\] \\(X_1 X_2\\) is the Interaction term. 2.4 How to select the best performing model After trying different linear models, you need to make a choice which model you want to use. More specifically, the questions that one can ask: “How to determine which model suits best to my data? Do I just look at the R square, SSE, etc.?” and “As the interpretation of that model (quadratic, root, etc.) will be very different, won’t it be an issue?” The second question can be answered easily. First, find a model that best suits to your data and then interpret its results. It is good if you have ideas how your data might be explained. However, interpret the best model, only. Now we will address the first question. Note that there are multiple ways to select a best model. In addition, this approach only applies to univariate models (simple models) whith just one input variable. Use the following interactive application and play around with different datasets and models. Notice how parameters change and become more confident with assessing simple linear models. Use the Adjusted \\(R_{adj}^2\\) for univariate models If you only use one input variable, the adjusted \\(R_{adj}^2\\) value gives you a good indication of how well your model performs. It illustrates how much variation is explained by your model. In contrast to the simple \\(R^2\\)9, the adjusted adjusted \\(R_{adj}^2\\)10 takes the number of input factors into account. It penalizes too many input factors and favors parsimonious models. The adjusted \\(R_{adj}^2\\) is sensitive to the amount of noise in the data. As such, only compare this indicator of models for the same dataset than comparing it across different datasets. Figure 2.1: Comparison of \\(R^2\\) and \\(R^2_{\\text{adj}}\\) for \\(n=200\\) and \\(p\\) ranging from \\(1\\) to \\(198\\). \\(M=100\\) datasets were simulated with only the first two predictors being significant. The thicker curves are the mean of each color’s curves. Figure 2.1 contains the results of an experiment where 100 datasets were simulated with only the first two predictors being significant. As you can see \\(R^2\\) increases linearly with the number of predictors considered, although only the first two ones were important! On the contrary, \\(R^2_\\text{adj}\\) only increases in the first two variables and then is flat on average, but it has a huge variability when \\(p\\) approaches \\(n-2\\). The experiment evidences that \\(R^2_\\text{adj}\\) is more adequate than the \\(R^2\\) for evaluating the fit of a multiple linear regression. Have a look at the residuals or error terms What is often ignored are error terms or so-called residuals. They often tell you more than what you might think. The residuals are the difference between your predicted values and the actual values. Their benefit is that they can show both the magnitude as well as the direction of the errors. Let’s have a look at an example: Here, we try to predict a polynomial dataset with a linear function. Analyzing the residuals shows that there are areas where the model has an upward or downward bias. For 50 &lt; x &lt; 100, the residuals are above zero. So in this area, the actual values have been higher than the predicted values — our model has a downward bias. For 100 &lt; x &lt; 150, however, the residuals are below zero. Thus, the actual values have been lower than the predicted values — the model has an upward bias. It is always good to know, whether your model suggests too high or too low values. But you usually do not want to have patterns like this. The residuals should be zero on average (as indicated by the mean) and they should be equally distributed. Predicting the same dataset with a polynomial function of 3 degrees suggests a much better fit: In addition, you can observe whether the variance of your errors increases. In statistics, this is called Heteroscedasticity. You can fix this easily with robust standard errors. Otherwise, your hypothesis tests are likely to be wrong. Histogram of residuals Finally, the histogram summarizes the magnitude of your error terms. It provides information about the bandwidth of errors and indicates how often which errors occurred. The above screenshots show two models for the same dataset. In the first histogram, errors occur within a range of -338 and 520. In the second histogram, errors occur within -293 and 401. So the outliers are much lower. Furthermore, most errors in the model of the second histogram are closer to zero. So we would favor the second model. ◼ Important to be sure that \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is minimising RSS.↩ Recal that ESS is the explained sum of squares, ESS = TSS - RSS.↩ More complex – included here just for clarification of the anova’s output.↩ Recall that \\(R^2 = 1- \\frac{\\text{RSS}}{\\text{TSS}}\\)↩ It is defined as \\(R_{adj}^2 = 1- \\frac{\\text{RSS}/(n-p-1)}{\\text{TSS}/(n-1)} = 1- \\frac{\\text{RSS}}{\\text{TSS}}\\times\\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}\\)↩ "],

The exercises Continue what we started last week with the Boston dataset which is part of the MASS package. Recall that this dataset records the median value of houses for 506 neighborhoods around Boston. 1. Load the Boston dataset from MASS package. 2. Split the dataset into traning set and testing set. (keep all the variables of the Boston data set) 3. Check if there is a linear relationship between the variables medv and age. (use cor() function). 4. Fit a model of housing prices in function of age and plot the observations and the regression line. 5. Train a regression model using both lstat and age as predictors of median house value. (Remember that we transformed lstat, use the same transformation here). What is the obtained model? 6. Print the summary of the obtained regression model. 7. Are the predictors significant ? 8. Is the model as a whole significant? Answer on this question must be detailed. 9. Train a new model using all the variables of the dataset. (We can use . as a short cut instead of writing down all the variables names) 10. When using all the variables as predictors, we didn’t transform lstat. Re train the model using log(lstat) instead of lstat. 11. Did \\(R^2\\) improve ? 12. To see if there is correlated variables print the correlation matrix using the cor() function (round the correlations with 2 digits). 13. Visualize the correlations using the corrplot package. To do so, install the corrplot package, load it, then use the function corrplot.mixed(). See this link for examples and to understand how to use it. 14. What is the correlation between tax and rad? 15. Run the model again without tax. What happens to the \\(R^2\\) ? and for the F-statistic? Of course R2 should go a little lower because we deleted one of the variables. But check for the model significance (F-statistic) gets higher, which means the p-values gets lower and thus the model is more significant without rad. 16. Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) for the last model. Anova Next we will apply an analysis of variances (ANOVA) in order to test if there is a significant difference of means between two groups \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) (Consider group \\(i\\) is the suburbs bounding the river and \\(j\\) the suburbs which not). The hypotheses are \\[ H_0 : \\mu_i = \\mu_j \\] \\[ H_1 : \\mu_i \\neq \\mu_j \\] Where \\(\\mu_i\\) is the mean of medv in group \\(i\\). 17. In the Boston data set there is a categorical variable chas which corresponds to Charles River (= 1 if a suburb bounds the river; 0 otherwise). Use command str() to see how this variable is present in the dataset. How many of the suburbs in this data set bound the Charles river? 18. Create Boxplots of the median value of houses with respect to the variable chas. Do we observe some difference between the median value of houses with respect to the neighborhood to Charles River? 19. Calculate \\(\\mu_i\\) and \\(\\mu_j\\) (in one line using the function aggregate()). 20. Apply an ANOVA test of medv whith respect to chas (use the function aov()). Print the result and the summary of it. what do you conclude ? Qualitative predictors Before starting the next question, please read section 2.3.1 and Appendix C about using qualitative predictors in regression. We are going to use the categorical variable chas which corresponds to Charles River (= 1 if a suburb bounds the river; 0 otherwise). Using the str() command you can notice that this variable is not codified as a factor, but it has values 0 or 1, so it is already dummyfied. 21. Fit a new model where the predictors are the Charles River and the Crime Rate. Interpret the coefficients of this model and conclude if the presence of the river adds a valuable information for explaining the house price. 22. Is chas is significant as well in the presence of more predictors? Interaction terms As you saw in section 2.3.1 we may sometimes try models with intercation terms. Let’s say we have two predictors \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\), the way of adding these interactions in lm is through : and *. The operator : only adds the term \\(X_1X_2\\) and * adds \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), and \\(X_1X_2\\). 23. Fit a model whith first order interaction term where predictors are lstat and age. Print its summary. 24. Fit a model with all the first order interaction terms. ◼ "],
["logistic-regression.html", "3 Logistic Regression 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Logistic Regression 3.3 Multiple Logistic Regression 3.4 Example", " 3 Logistic Regression 3.1 Introduction In the previous chapters we discussed the linear regression model, which assumes that the response variable \\(Y\\) is quantitative. But in many situations, the response variable is instead qualitative (categorical). For example, eye color is qualitative, taking on values blue, brown, or green. The process for predicting qualitative responses is known as classification. Given a feature vector \\(X\\) and a qualitative response \\(Y\\) taking values in the set \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), the classification task is to build a function \\(C(X)\\) that takes as input the feature vector \\(X\\) and predicts its value for \\(Y\\); i.e. \\(C(X) \\in \\mathcal{C}\\). We are often more interested in estimating the probabilities that \\(X\\) belongs to each category in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). If \\(c\\) is a category (\\(c \\in \\mathcal{C}\\)), by the probability that \\(X\\) belongs to \\(c\\) we mean \\(p(X \\in c) = \\mathbb{P}(Y=c|X)\\). In the binomial or binary logistic regression, the outcome can have only two possible types of values (e.g. “Yes” or “No”, “Success” or “Failure”). Multinomial logistic refers to cases where the outcome can have three or more possible types of values (e.g., “good” vs. “very good” vs. “best”). Generally outcome is coded as “0” and “1” in binary logistic regression. 3.2 Logistic Regression Consider a data set where the response falls into one of two categories, Yes or No. Rather than modeling the response \\(Y\\) directly, logistic regression models the probability that \\(Y\\) belongs to a particular category. 3.2.1 The Logistic Model Let us suppose the response has two categories and we use the generic 0/1 coding for the response. How should we model the relationship between \\(p(X) = \\mathbb{P}(Y = 1|X)\\) and \\(X\\)? The simplest situation is when \\(Y\\) is binary: it can only take two values, codified for convenience as \\(1\\) (success) and \\(0\\) (failure). More formally, a binary variable is known as a Bernoulli variable, which is the simplest non-trivial random variable. We say that \\(Y\\sim\\mathrm{Ber}(p)\\), \\(0\\leq p\\leq1\\), if \\[ Y=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}1,&amp;\\text{with probability }p,\\\\0,&amp;\\text{with probability }1-p,\\end{array}\\right. \\] or, equivalently, if \\(\\mathbb{P}[Y=1]=p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{P}[Y=0]=1-p\\), which can be written compactly as \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{P}[Y=y]=p^y(1-p)^{1-y},\\quad y=0,1. \\end{aligned}\\] Recall that a binomial variable with size \\(n\\) and probability \\(p\\), \\(\\mathrm{Bi}(n,p)\\), was obtained by adding \\(n\\) independent \\(\\mathrm{Ber}(p)\\) (so \\(\\mathrm{Ber}(p)\\) is the same as \\(\\mathrm{Bi}(1,p)\\)). A Bernoulli variable Y is completely determined by p. So its mean and variance: 攼㹤愼㸰戼㸵攼㹤戼㸴戼㹣[Y]=p × 1 + (1 − p)×0 = p 攼㹤愼㸰戼㸵攼㹤戼㸵㠼㹤ar[Y]=p(1 − p). In particular, recall that ℙ[Y = 1]=攼㹤愼㸰戼㸵攼㹤戼㸴戼㹣[Y]=p. Assume then that \\(Y\\) is a binary/Bernoulli variable and that \\(X\\) are predictors associated to them (no particular assumptions on them). The purpose in logistic regression is to estimate \\[ p(x)=\\mathbb{P}[Y=1|X=x]=\\mathbb{E}[Y|X=x], \\] this is, how the probability of \\(Y=1\\) is changing according to particular values, denoted by \\(x\\), of the random variables \\(X\\). Why not linear regression? A tempting possibility is to consider the model \\[ p(x)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x. \\] However, such a model will run into problems inevitably: negative probabilities and probabilities larger than one (\\(p(x) &lt; 0\\) for some values of \\(X\\) and \\(p(X) &gt; 1\\) for others). To avoid this problem, the solution is to consider a function to encapsulate the value of \\(z=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x\\), in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), and map it to \\([0,1]\\). There are several alternatives to do so, based on distribution functions \\(F:\\mathbb{R}\\longrightarrow[0,1]\\) that deliver \\(y=F(z)\\in[0,1]\\). Many functions meet this description. In logistic regression, we use the logistic function, \\[ p(X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X}}{1+e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X}} \\] No matter what values β0, β1 or X take, p(X) will have values between 0 and 1. The logistic function will always produce an S-shaped curve. The logistic distribution function is: \\[F(z)=\\mathrm{logistic}(z)=\\frac{e^z}{1+e^z}=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}.\\] After a bit of manipulation of the previous equation, we find that \\[ \\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)} = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X} \\] The quantity p(X)/[1 − p(X)] is called the odds, and can take on any value between 0 and ∞. By taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation, we arrive at \\[ \\log( \\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)} ) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X \\] The left-hand side is called the log-odds or logit. We see that the logistic regression model has a logit that is linear in X. 3.2.2 Estimating the Regression Coefficients We estimate \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation method (MLE). The basic intuition behind using maximum likelihood to fit a logistic regression model is as follows: we seek estimates for \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) such that the predicted probability \\(\\hat{p}(x_i)\\) of the response for each individual, corresponds as closely as possible to the individual’s observed response status (recall that the response \\(Y\\) is categorical). The likelihood function is \\[ l(\\beta_0,\\beta_1) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i)^{Y_i}(1-p(x_i))^{1-Y_i}. \\] This likelihood is the probability of the data based on the model. It gives the probability of the observed zeros and ones in the data. The estimates \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) are chosen to maximize this likelihood function. The interpretation of the likelihood function is the following: \\(\\prod_{i=1}^n\\) appears because the sample elements are assumed to be independent and we are computing the probability of observing the whole sample \\((x_{1},y_1),\\ldots,(x_{n},y_n)\\). This probability is equal to the product of the probabilities of observing each \\((x_{i},y_i)\\). \\(p(x_i)^{Y_i}(1-p(x_i))^{1-Y_i}\\) is the probability of observing \\((x_{i},Y_i)\\). In the linear regression setting, the least squares approach is a special case of maximum likelihood. We will not give mathematical details about the maximum likelihood and how to estimate the parameters. We will use R to fit the logistic regression models (using glm function). Use the following application (also available here) to see how the log-likelihood changes with respect to the values for \\((\\beta_0,\\beta_1)\\) in three data patterns. The logistic regression fit and its dependence on \\(\\beta_0\\) (horizontal displacement) and \\(\\beta_1\\) (steepness of the curve). Recall the effect of the sign of \\(\\beta_1\\) in the curve: if positive, the logistic curve has an \\(s\\) form; if negative, the form is a reflected \\(s\\).

It produces the blue curve that separates that data in the following figure, As for prediction, we use the model built with the estimated parameters to predict probabilities. For example, If \\(X=1000\\), \\[ \\hat{p}(X) = \\frac{e^{\\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} X}}{1+e^{\\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} X}} = \\frac{e^{-10.6513+0.0055 \\times 1000}}{1+e^{-10.6513+0.0055 \\times 1000}} = 0.006\\] If \\(X=2000\\), \\[ \\hat{p}(X) = \\frac{e^{\\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} X}}{1+e^{\\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} X}} = \\frac{e^{-10.6513+0.0055 \\times 2000}}{1+e^{-10.6513+0.0055 \\times 2000}} = 0.586\\] 3.3 Multiple Logistic Regression We now consider the problem of predicting a binary response using multiple predictors. By analogy with the extension from simple to multiple linear regression in the previous chapters, we can generalize the simple logistic regression equation as follows: \\[ \\log( \\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)} ) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_p X_p\\] where \\(X=(X_1,\\ldots,X_p)\\) are \\(p\\) predictors. The equation above can be rewritten as \\[ p(X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_p X_p}}{1+e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_p X_p}} \\] Just as in the simple logistic regression we use the maximum likelihood method to estimate \\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_p\\). 3.4 Example 3.4.1 Case study: The Challenger disaster The Challenger disaster occurred on the 28th January of 1986, when the NASA Space Shuttle orbiter Challenger broke apart and disintegrated at 73 seconds into its flight, leading to the deaths of its seven crew members. The accident deeply shocked the US society, in part due to the attention the mission had received because of the presence of Christa McAuliffe, who would have been the first astronaut-teacher. Because of this, NASA TV broadcasted live the launch to US public schools, which resulted in millions of school children witnessing the accident. The accident had serious consequences for the NASA credibility and resulted in an interruption of 32 months in the shuttle program. The Presidential Rogers Commission (formed by astronaut Neil A. Armstrong and Nobel laureate Richard P. Feynman, among others) was created to investigate the disaster. Figure 3.1: Challenger launch and posterior explosion, as broadcasted live by NBC in 28/01/1986. The Rogers Commission elaborated a report (Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident 1986) with all the findings. The commission determined that the disintegration began with the failure of an O-ring seal in the solid rocket motor due to the unusual cold temperatures (-0.6 Celsius degrees) during the launch. This failure produced a breach of burning gas through the solid rocket motor that compromised the whole shuttle structure, resulting in its disintegration due to the extreme aerodynamic forces. The problematic with O-rings was something known: the night before the launch, there was a three-hour teleconference between motor engineers and NASA management, discussing the effect of low temperature forecasted for the launch on the O-ring performance. The conclusion, influenced by Figure 3.2a, was: “Temperature data [are] not conclusive on predicting primary O-ring blowby.” Figure 3.2: Number of incidents in the O-rings (filed joints) versus temperatures. Panel a includes only flights with incidents. Panel b contains all flights (with and without incidents). The Rogers Commission noted a major flaw in Figure 3.2a: the flights with zero incidents were excluded from the plot because it was felt that these flights did not contribute any information about the temperature effect (Figure 3.2b). The Rogers Commission concluded: “A careful analysis of the flight history of O-ring performance would have revealed the correlation of O-ring damage in low temperature”. The purpose of this case study, inspired by Dalal, Fowlkes, and Hoadley (1989), is to quantify what was the influence of the temperature in the probability of having at least one incident related with the O-rings. Specifically, we want to address the following questions: Q1. Is the temperature associated with O-ring incidents? Q2. In which way was the temperature affecting the probability of O-ring incidents? Q3. What was the predicted probability of an incidient in an O-ring for the temperature of the launch day? To try to answer these questions we have the challenger ( dataset ). The dataset contains (as shown in the table below) information regarding the state of the solid rocket boosters after launch11 for 23 flights. Each row has, among others, the following variables: fail.field, fail.nozzle: binary variables indicating whether there was an incident with the O-rings in the field joints or in the nozzles of the solid rocket boosters. 1 codifies an incident and 0 its absence. On the analysis, we focus on the O-rings of the field joint as being the most determinants for the accident. temp: temperature in the day of launch. Measured in Celsius degrees. pres.field, pres.nozzle: leak-check pressure tests of the O-rings. These tests assured that the rings would seal the joint. Table 3.1: The challenger dataset. flight date fail.field fail.nozzle temp 1 12/04/81 0 0 18.9 2 12/11/81 1 0 21.1 3 22/03/82 0 0 20.6 5 11/11/82 0 0 20.0 6 04/04/83 0 1 19.4 7 18/06/83 0 0 22.2 8 30/08/83 0 0 22.8 9 28/11/83 0 0 21.1 41-B 03/02/84 1 1 13.9 41-C 06/04/84 1 1 17.2 41-D 30/08/84 1 1 21.1 41-G 05/10/84 0 0 25.6 51-A 08/11/84 0 0 19.4 51-C 24/01/85 1 1 11.7 51-D 12/04/85 0 1 19.4 51-B 29/04/85 0 1 23.9 51-G 17/06/85 0 1 21.1 51-F 29/07/85 0 0 27.2 51-I 27/08/85 0 0 24.4 51-J 03/10/85 0 0 26.1 61-A 30/10/85 1 0 23.9 61-B 26/11/85 0 1 24.4 61-C 12/01/86 1 1 14.4 Let’s begin the analysis by replicating Figures 3.2a and 3.2b and checking that linear regression is not the right tool for answering Q1–Q3. For that, we make two scatterplots of nfails.field (number of total incidents in the field joints) in function of temp, the first one excluding the launches without incidents (subset = nfails.field &gt; 0) and the second one for all the data. library(car) scatterplot(nfails.field ~ temp, reg.line = lm, smooth = FALSE, spread = FALSE, boxplots = FALSE, data = challenger, subset = nfails.field &gt; 0) scatterplot(nfails.field ~ temp, reg.line = lm, smooth = FALSE, spread = FALSE, boxplots = FALSE, data = challenger) There is a fundamental problem in using linear regression for this data: the response is not continuous. As a consequence, there is no linearity and the errors around the mean are not normal (indeed, they are strongly non normal). We can check this with the corresponding diagnostic plots: mod &lt;- lm(nfails.field ~ temp, data = challenger) par(mfrow = 1:2) plot(mod, 1) plot(mod, 2) Although linear regression is not the adequate tool for this data, it is able to detect the obvious difference between the two plots: The trend for launches with incidents is flat, hence suggesting there is no dependence on the temperature (Figure 3.2a). This was one of the arguments behind NASA’s decision of launching the rocket at a temperature of -0.6 degrees. However, the trend for all launches indicates a clear negative dependence between temperature and number of incidents! (Figure 3.2b). Think about it in this way: the minimum temperature for a launch without incidents ever recorded was above 18 degrees, and the Challenger was launched at -0.6 without clearly knowing the effects of such low temperatures. Instead of trying to predict the number of incidents, we will concentrate on modeling the probability of expecting at least one incident given the temperature, a simpler but also revealing approach. In other words, we look to estimate the following curve: \\[ p(x)=\\mathbb{P}(\\text{incident}=1|\\text{temperature}=x) \\] from fail.field and temp. This probability can not be properly modeled as a linear function like \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x\\), since inevitably will fall outside \\([0,1]\\) for some value of \\(x\\) (some will have negative probabilities or probabilities larger than one). The technique that solves this problem is the logistic regression. The logistic model in this case is \\[ \\mathbb{P}(\\text{incident}=1|\\text{temperature}=x)=\\text{logistic}\\left(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x\\right)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x)}}, \\] with \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) unknown. Let’s fit the model to the data by estimating \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). nasa &lt;- glm(fail.field ~ temp, family = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = challenger) summary(nasa) #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Call: #ans&gt; glm(formula = fail.field ~ temp, family = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = challenger) #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Deviance Residuals: #ans&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #ans&gt; -1.057 -0.757 -0.382 0.457 2.220 #ans&gt; #ans&gt; Coefficients: #ans&gt; Estimate Std.

The syntax of the glm() function is similar to that of lm(), except that we must pass in the argument family=binomial in order to tell R to run a logistic regression rather than some other type of generalized linear model. The summary of the logistic model is notably different from the linear regression, as the methodology behind is quite different. Nevertheless, we have tests for the significance of each coefficient. Here we obtain that temp is significantly different from zero, at least at a level \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). Therefore we can conclude that the temperature is indeed affecting the probability of an incident with the O-rings (answers Q1). The coefficient of temp, \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\), can be regarded the “correlation between the temperature and the probability of having at least one incident”. This correlation, as evidenced by the sign of \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\), is negative. Let’s plot the fitted logistic curve to see that indeed the probability of incident and temperature are negatively correlated: # Plot data plot(challenger$temp, challenger$fail.field, xlim = c(-1, 30), xlab = &quot;Temperature&quot;, ylab = &quot;Incident probability&quot;) # Draw the fitted logistic curve x &lt;- seq(-1, 30, l = 200) y &lt;- exp(-(nasa$coefficients[1] + nasa$coefficients[2] * x)) y &lt;- 1 / (1 + y) lines(x, y, col = 2, lwd = 2) # The Challenger points(-0.6, 1, pch = 16) text(-0.6, 1, labels = &quot;Challenger&quot;, pos = 4) At the sight of this curve and the summary of the model we can conclude that the temperature was increasing the probability of an O-ring incident (Q2). Indeed, the confidence intervals for the coefficients show a significative negative correlation at level \\(\\alpha=0.05\\): confint(nasa, level = 0.95) #ans&gt; 2.5 % 97.5 % #ans&gt; (Intercept) 1.336 17.783 #ans&gt; temp -0.924 -0.109 Finally, the probability of having at least one incident with the O-rings in the launch day was \\(0.9996\\) according to the fitted logistic model (Q3). This is easily obtained: predict(nasa, newdata = data.frame(temp = -0.6), type = &quot;response&quot;) #ans&gt; 1 #ans&gt; 1 Be aware that type = &quot;response&quot; has a different meaning in logistic regression. In linear models it returns a CI for the prediction. But, type = &quot;response&quot; means that the probability should be returned, instead of the value of the link function, which is returned with type = &quot;link&quot; (the default). Recall that there is a serious problem of extrapolation in the prediction, which makes it less precise (or more variable). But this extrapolation, together with the evidences raised by a simple analysis like we did, should have been strong arguments for postponing the launch. ◼ E References "],

Social Networks Ads In this PW we are going to analyse the Social_Network_Ads dataset . This dataset contains informations of users of a social network. The social network has several business clients and its business clients put ads on the social network for marketing compaigns purposes. For this dataset, a company has put ads for one of its new products and the social network gathered some informations about wich users responded positively to the ad by buying the product and those who responded negatively by not buying the product. 1. Download the Social_Network_Ads dataset and import it into R. 2. Explore and Describe the dataset (you can use str() and summary() functions, you can calculate and visualize the correlations, show some histograms, scatterplots, pie charts, etc..). We will consider the variables Age and EstimatedSalary as input variables (features) to see the correlations between them and the decision of the user to buy (or not) the product. 3. Now we are going to split the dataset into training set and test set. Last week we did it manually. From now on we will split it randomly, you can use this code (after undestanding it of course): library(caTools) # install it first in the console set.seed(123) # we use the function set.seed() with the same seed number # to randomly generate the same values, you already know that right? #and you know why we want to generate the same values, am I wrong? split = sample.split(dataset$Purchased, SplitRatio = 0.75) # here we chose the SplitRatio to 75% of the dataset, # and 25% for the test set. training_set = subset(dataset, split == TRUE) # we use subset to split the dataset test_set = subset(dataset, split == FALSE) 4. Scale the input variables in both training set and test set. Do you know what is scaling? Explain it one sentence. 5. Now fit a simple logistic regression model of Purchased in function of Age. 6. As you saw in the Logistic Regression chapter and in the previous question, we choose argument family to be binomial when we use the function glm. Explain why! 7. Write in a equation the model you obtained in question 5? (Read the following note concerning this question). Note that: 1- There is three different ways to express the equation of a Logistic Regression model. 2- Use inline codes to call the coefficients instead of writing them manually. 3- You can use Latex to simplify writing equations, you just need to put the equation code between two $$. For example: $e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X}$ will give eβ0 + β1X. Try some equations on this website). 4- In fact, for any equation shown on this website, you can right click on it and see its corresonding Latex code. 8. Is the feature Age significant to the model? Justify your answer. 9. What is the value of AIC of the model? The AIC is the Akaike Information Criterion. You will use this while comparing multiple models. The model with lower value of AIC is better. Suppose that we have a statistical model of some data. Let \\({\\hat {L}}\\) be the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model; let k be the number of estimated parameters in the model. Then the AIC value of the model is the following. \\[ \\text{AIC} = 2 k-2 \\ln(\\hat{L})\\] where \\(\\hat{L}\\) = the maximized value of the likelihood function of the model M, i.e. \\(\\hat{L}=p(x|{\\hat{\\beta }},M)\\), where \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) are the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function. x = the observed data. k = the number of free parameters to be estimated. If the model under consideration is a linear regression, k is the number of regressors, including the intercept. 10. Plot Purchased in function of Age and add the curve of the obtained logistic regression model. (Hints: One way to do it is to first plot the observations, then use the curve() function with option add=TRUE in order to add the curve to the plot. Pay attention that the argument “type” of the function predict() must be reponse) You must obtain something like Extra: A great R package for visualization if ggplot2. Take a look on this link for some examples. With this library we obtain the following plot for our model, I obtained the last figure with these lines of code, library(ggplot2) ggplot(training_set, aes(x=Age, y=Purchased)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&quot;glm&quot;, method.args=list(family=&quot;binomial&quot;), se=FALSE) 11. Now let us take another feature into account in the model. Fit a logistic regression model of purchasing the product in function of the age of a user and its salary. 12. Are the predictors significant to the new model? 13. Do we obtain a better model by adding the estimated salary? 14. Predictions: On the test set, predict the probability of purchasing the product by the users using the obtained model. 15. Take a look on your predicted values for the variable Purchased. We predicted the probability that the user will purchase the product right? Now in order to compare your results with the real answers, transform the predicted values to 0 or 1 (1 if &gt;0.5). Hint: You can easily do it with the ifelse() function. Now read the following about the evaluation of a classifier (of a classification model). Confusion matrix: is a tabular representation of Actual vs Predicted values. This helps us to find the accuracy of the model. The different results from a binary classifier are true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This is how the confusion matrix looks like: (Image source: Wikipedia) You can calculate the accuracy of your model with: Accuracy is a key measure of performance, and is more specifically the rate at which the model is able to predict the correct value (classification or regression) for a given data point or observation. In other words, accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. The other two metrics from the confusion matrix worth discussing are Precision and Recall. Precision (positive predictive value) is the ratio of true positives to the total amount of positive predictions made (i.e., true or false). Said another way, precision measures the proportion of accurate positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall on the other hand, or true positive rate, is the ratio of true positives to the total amount of actual positives, whether predicted correctly or not. So in other words, recall measures the proportion of accurate positive predictions out of all actual positive observations. A metric that is associated with precision and recall is called the F-score (also called F1 score), which combines them mathematically, and somewhat like a weighted average, in order to produce a single measure of performance based on the simultaneous values of both. Its values range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best). Another important concept to know about is the Receiver Operating Characteristic, which when plotted, results in what’s known as an ROC curve. ROC Curve: An ROC curve is a two-dimensional plot of sensitivity (recall, or true positive rate) vs specificity (false positive rate). The area under the curve is referred to as the AUC, and is a numeric metric used to represent the quality and performance of the classifier (model). An AUC of 0.5 is essentially the same as random guessing without a model, whereas an AUC of 1.0 is considered a perfect classifier. Generally, the higher the AUC value the better, and an AUC above 0.8 is considered quite good. The higher the AUC value, the closer the curve gets to the upper left corner of the plot. One can easily see from the ROC curves then that the goal is to find and tune a model that maximizes the true positive rate, while simultaneously minimizing the false positive rate. Said another way, the goal as shown by the ROC curve is to correctly predict as many of the actual positives as possible, while also predicting as many of the actual negatives as possible, and therefore minimize errors (incorrect classifications) for both. 16. Now in order to evaluate the model and its predictions, compute the confusion matrix. What do you obtain ? (Hint: you can use the table() function). 17. Calculate the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and the precision of the model. (Note: You can create a function that takes a confusion matrix in input and returns the needed metrics) 18. Plot the ROC curve and calculate AUC value. Hints: to plot it, install the ROCR package. Load and use the functions: prediction() to calculate the elements of the confusion matrix. performance() to calculate the AUC. plot() to plot the ROC curve, you can plot the performance calculated before. abline() to plot a line of equation y=x. 19. Compare the AUC of the two models you fitted (one with only age and one with age and estimated salary) and plot their ROC curves in the same figure. ◼ "],

We will start first by the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). 4.1 Introduction As we saw in the previous chapter, Logistic regression involves directly modeling \\(\\mathbb{P} (Y = k|X = x)\\) using the logistic function, for the case of two response classes. In logistic regression, we model the conditional distribution of the response \\(Y\\), given the predictor(s) \\(X\\). We now consider an alternative and less direct approach to estimating these probabilities. In this alternative approach, we model the distribution of the predictors \\(X\\) separately in each of the response classes (i.e. given \\(Y\\)), and then use Bayes’ theorem to flip these around into estimates for \\(\\mathbb{P} (Y = k|X = x)\\). When these distributions are assumed to be Normal, it turns out that the model is very similar in form to logistic regression. Why not logistic regression? Why do we need another method, when we have logistic regression? There are several reasons: When the classes are well-separated, the parameter estimates for the logistic regression model are surprisingly unstable. Linear discriminant analysis does not suﬀer from this problem. If \\(n\\) is small and the distribution of the predictors \\(X\\) is approximately normal in each of the classes, the linear discriminant model is again more stable than the logistic regression model. Linear discriminant analysis is popular when we have more than two response classes. 4.2 Bayes’ Theorem Bayes’ theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation: \\[ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}\\] where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are events and \\(P(B) \\neq 0\\). \\(P(A | B)\\), a conditional probability, is the probability of observing event \\(A\\) given that \\(B\\) is true. It is called the posterior probability. \\(P(A)\\), is called the prior, is the initial degree of belief in A. \\(P(B)\\) is the likelihood. The posterior probability can be written in the memorable form as : Posterior probability ∝ Likelihood × Prior probability. Extended form: Suppose we have a partition \\(\\{A_i\\}\\) of the sample space, the even space is given or conceptualized in terms of \\(P(A_j)\\) and \\(P(B | A_j)\\). It is then useful to compute \\(P(B)\\) using the law of total probability: \\[ P(B) = \\sum_j P(B|A_j) P(A_j) \\] \\[ \\Rightarrow P(A_i|B) = \\frac{P(B|A_i) P(A_i)}{\\sum_j P(B|A_j) P(A_j)} \\] Bayes’ Theorem for Classification: Suppose that we wish to classify an observation into one of \\(K\\) classes, where \\(K \\geq 2\\). In other words, the qualitative response variable \\(Y\\) can take on \\(K\\) possible distinct and unordered values. Let \\(\\pi_k\\) represent the overall or prior probability that a randomly chosen observation comes from the \\(k\\)-th class; this is the probability that a given observation is associated with the \\(k\\)-th category of the response variable \\(Y\\). Let \\(f_k(X) \\equiv P(X = x|Y = k)\\) denote the density function of \\(X\\) for an observation that comes from the \\(k\\)-th class. In other words, \\(f_k(x)\\) is relatively large if there is a high probability that an observation in the \\(k\\)-th class has \\(X \\approx x\\), and \\(f_k(x)\\) is small if it is very unlikely that an observation in the \\(k\\)-th class has \\(X \\approx x\\). Then Bayes’ theorem states that \\[\\begin{equation} P(Y=k|X=x) = \\frac{ \\pi_k f_k(x)}{\\sum_{c=1}^K \\pi_c f_c(x)} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] As we did in the last chapter, we will use the abbreviation \\(p_k(X) =P(Y = k|X)\\). The equation above stated by Bayes’ theorem suggests that instead of directly computing \\(p_k(X)\\) as we did in the logistic regression, we can simply plug in estimates of \\(\\pi_k\\) and \\(f_k(X)\\) into the equation. In general, estimating \\(\\pi_k\\) is easy (the fraction of the training observations that belong to the \\(k\\)-th class). But estimating \\(f_k(X)\\) tends to be more challenging. Recall that \\(p_k(x)\\) is the posterior probability that an observation \\(X=x\\) belongs to \\(k\\)-th class. If we can find a way to estimate \\(f_k(X)\\), we can develop a classifier with the lowest possibe error rate out of all classifiers. 4.3 LDA for \\(p=1\\) Assume that \\(p=1\\), which mean we have only one predictor. We would like to obtain an estimate for \\(f_k(x)\\) that we can plug into the Equation (4.1) in order to estimate \\(p_k(x)\\). We will then classify an observation to the class for which \\(p_k(x)\\) is greatest. In order to estimate \\(f_k(x)\\), we will first make some assumptions about its form. Suppose we assume that \\(f_k(x)\\) is normal (Gaussian). In the one-dimensional setting, the normal density take the form \\[\\begin{equation} f_k(x)= \\frac{1}{\\sigma_k\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\big( - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_k^2 } (x-\\mu_k)^2\\big) \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mu_k\\) and \\(\\sigma_k^2\\) are the mean and variance parameters for \\(k\\)-th class. Let us assume that \\(\\sigma_1^2 = \\ldots = \\sigma_K^2 = \\sigma\\) (which means there is a shared variance term across all \\(K\\) classes). Plugging Eq. (4.2) into the Bayes formula in Eq. (4.1) we get, \\[\\begin{equation} p_k(x) = \\frac{ \\pi_k \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\big(\\frac{x-\\mu_k}{\\sigma}\\big)^2 } }{ \\sum_{c=1}^K \\pi_c \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\big(\\frac{x-\\mu_c}{\\sigma}\\big)^2 } } \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] Note that πk and πc denote the prior probabilities. And π is the mathematical constant π ≈ 3.14159. To classify at the value \\(X = x\\), we need to see which of the \\(p_k(x)\\) is largest. Taking logs, and discarding terms that do not depend on \\(k\\), we see that this is equivalent to assigning \\(x\\) to the class with the largest discriminant score: \\[\\begin{equation} \\delta_k(x) = x.\\frac{\\mu_k}{\\sigma^2} - \\frac{\\mu_k^2}{2\\sigma^2} + \\log (\\pi_k) \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] Note that \\(\\delta_k(x)\\) is a linear function of \\(x\\). The decision surfaces for a linear discriminant classifiers are defined by the linear equations δk(x)=δc(x). Example: If K = 2 and π1 = π2, then the desicion boundary is at \\(x=\\frac{\\mu_1+\\mu2}{2}\\) (Prove it!). An example where μ1 = −1.5, μ2 = 1.5, π1 = π2 = 0.5 and σ2 = 1 is shown in this following figure See this video to understand more about decision boundary (Applied on logistic regression). As we classify a new point according to which density is highest, when the priors are diﬀerent we take them into account as well, and compare πkfk(x). On the right of the following figure, we favor the pink class (remark that the decision boundary has shifted to the left). 4.4 Estimating the parameters Typically we don’t know these parameters; we just have the training data. In that case we simply estimate the parameters and plug them into the rule. Let \\(n\\) the total number of training observations, and \\(n_k\\) the number of training observations in the \\(k\\)-th class. The following estimates are used: \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{\\pi}_k &amp;= \\frac{n_k}{n} \\\\ \\hat{\\mu}_k &amp;= \\frac{1}{n_k} \\sum_{i: y_i=k} x_i \\\\ \\hat{\\sigma}^2 &amp;= \\frac{1}{n - K} \\sum_{k=1}^K \\sum_{i: y_i=k} (x_i-\\hat{\\mu}_k)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k=1}^K \\frac{n_k-1}{n - K} . \\hat{\\sigma}_k^2 \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_k^2 = \\frac{1}{n_k-1}\\sum_{i: y_i=k}(x_i-\\hat{\\mu}_k)^2\\) is the usual formula for the estimated variance in the -\\(k\\)-th class. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier plugs these estimates in Eq. (4.4) and assigns an observation \\(X=x\\) to the class for which \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\delta}_k(x) = x.\\frac{\\hat{\\mu}_k}{\\hat{\\sigma}^2} - \\frac{\\hat{\\mu}_k^2}{2\\hat{\\sigma}^2} + \\log (\\hat{\\pi}_k) \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] is largest. The discriminant functions in Eq. (4.5) are linear functions of \\(x\\). Recall that we assumed that the observations come from a normal distribution with a common variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). 4.5 LDA for \\(p &gt; 1\\) Let us now suppose that we have multiple predictors. We assume that \\(X=(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_p)\\) is drawn from multivariate Gaussian distribution (assuming they have a common covariance matrix, e.g. same variances as in the case of \\(p=1\\)). The multivariate Gaussian distribution assumes that each individual predictor follows a one-dimensional normal distribution as in Eq. (4.2), with some correlation between each pair of predictors. To indicate that a \\(p\\)-dimensional random variable \\(X\\) has a multivariate Gaussian distribution, we write \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)\\). Where \\[ \\mu = E(X) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_1 \\\\ \\mu_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mu_p \\end{pmatrix} \\] and, \\[ \\Sigma = Cov(X) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_1^2 &amp; Cov[X_1, X_2] &amp; \\dots &amp; Cov[X_1, X_p] \\\\ Cov[X_2, X_1] &amp; \\sigma_2^2 &amp; \\dots &amp; Cov[X_2, X_p] \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ Cov[X_p, X_1] &amp; Cov[X_p, X_2] &amp; \\dots &amp; \\sigma_p^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\] \\(\\Sigma\\) is the \\(p\\times p\\) covariance matrix of \\(X\\). Formally, the multivariate Gaussian density is deﬁned as \\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{p/2} |\\Sigma|^{1/2}} \\exp \\bigg( - \\frac{1}{2} (x-\\mu)^T \\Sigma^{-1} (x-\\mu) \\bigg) \\] Plugging the density function for the \\(k\\)-th class, \\(f_k(X=x)\\), into Eq. (4.1) reveals that the Bayes classifier assigns an observation \\(X=x\\) to the class for which \\[\\begin{equation} \\delta_k(x) = x^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_k^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k + \\log \\pi_k \\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] is largest. This is the vector/matrix version of (4.4). An example is shown in the following figure. Three equally-sized Gaussian classes are shown with class-specific mean vectors and a common covariance matrix (\\(\\pi_1=\\pi_2=\\pi_3=1/3\\)). The three ellipses represent regions that contain \\(95\\%\\) of the probability for each of the three classes. The dashed lines are the Bayes decision boundaries. Recall that the decision boundaries represent the set of values \\(x\\) for which \\(\\delta_k(x)=\\delta_c(x)\\); i.e. for \\(k\\neq c\\) \\[ x^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_k^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k = x^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_c - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_c^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_c \\] Note that there are three lines representing the Bayes decision boundaries because there are three pairs of classes among the three classes. That is, one Bayes decision boundary separates class 1 from class 2, one separates class 1 from class 3, and one separates class 2 from class 3. These three Bayes decision boundaries divide the predictor space into three regions. The Bayes classiﬁer will classify an observation according to the region in which it is located. Once again, we need to estimate the unknown parameters \\(\\mu_1,\\ldots,\\mu_k,\\) and \\(\\pi_1,\\ldots,\\pi_k,\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\); the formulas are similar to those used in the one-dimensional case. To assign a new observation \\(X = x\\), LDA plugs these estimates into Eq. (4.6) and classiﬁes to the class for which \\(\\delta_k(x)\\) is largest. Note that in Eq. (4.6) \\(\\delta_k(x)\\) is a linear function of \\(x\\); that is, the LDA decision rule depends on x only through a linear combination of its elements. This is the reason for the word linear in LDA. 4.6 Making predictions Once we have estimates \\(\\hat{\\delta}_k(x)\\), we can turn these into estimates for class probabilities: \\[ \\hat{P}(Y=k|X=x)= \\frac{e^{\\hat{\\delta}_k(x)}}{\\sum_{c=1}^K e^{\\hat{\\delta}_c(x)}} \\] So classifying to the largest \\(\\hat{\\delta}_k(x)\\) amounts to classifying to the class for which \\(\\hat{P}(Y=k|X=x)\\) is largest. When \\(K=2\\), we classify to class 2 if \\(\\hat{P}(Y=2|X=x) \\geq 0.5\\), else to class 1. 4.7 Other forms of Discriminant Analysis \\[P(Y=k|X=x) = \\frac{ \\pi_k f_k(x)}{\\sum_{c=1}^K \\pi_c f_c(x)}\\] We saw before that when \\(f_k(x)\\) are Gaussian densities, whith the same covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) in each class, this leads to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). By altering the forms for \\(f_k(x)\\), we get different classifiers. With Gaussians but different \\(\\Sigma_k\\) in each class, we get Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). With \\(f_k(x) = \\prod_{j=1}^p f_{jk}(x_j)\\) (conditional independence model) in each class we get Naive Bayes. (For Gaussian, this mean the \\(\\Sigma_k\\) are diagonal, e.g. \\(Cov(X_i,X_j)=0 \\,\\, \\forall \\, \\, 1\\leq i,j \\leq p\\)). Many other forms by proposing specific density models for \\(f_k(x)\\), including nonparametric approaches. 4.7.1 Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) Like LDA, the QDA classiﬁer results from assuming that the observations from each class are drawn from a Gaussian distribution, and plugging estimates for the parameters into Bayes’ theorem in order to perform prediction. However, unlike LDA, QDA assumes that each class has its own covariance matrix. Under this assumption, the Bayes classiﬁer assigns an observation \\(X = x\\) to the class for which \\[\\begin{align*} \\delta_k(x) &amp;= - \\frac{1}{2} (x-\\mu)^T \\Sigma_k^{-1} (x-\\mu) - \\frac{1}{2} \\log |\\Sigma_k| + \\log \\pi_k \\\\ &amp;= - \\frac{1}{2} x^T \\Sigma_k^{-1} x + \\frac{1}{2} x^T \\Sigma_k^{-1} \\mu_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_k^T \\Sigma_k^{-1} \\mu_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\log |\\Sigma_k| + \\log \\pi_k \\end{align*}\\] is largest. Unlike in LDA, the quantity \\(x\\) appears as a quadratic function in QDA. This is where QDA gets its name. The decision boundary in QDA is non-linear. It is quadratic (a curve). 4.7.2 Naive Bayes We use Naive Bayes classifier if the features are independant in each class. It is useful when \\(p\\) is large (unklike LDA and QDA). Naive Bayes assumes that each \\(\\Sigma_k\\) is diagonal, so \\[\\begin{align*} \\delta_k(x) &amp;\\propto \\log \\bigg[\\pi_k \\prod_{j=1}^p f_{kj}(x_j) \\bigg] \\\\ &amp;= -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^p \\frac{(x_j-\\mu_{kj})^2}{\\sigma_{kj}^2} + \\log \\pi_k \\end{align*}\\] It can used for mixed feature vectors (qualitative and quantitative). If \\(X_j\\) is qualitative, we replace \\(f_{kj}(x_j)\\) by probability mass function (histogram) over discrete categories. 4.8 LDA vs Logistic Regression the logistic regression and LDA methods are closely connected. Consider the two-class setting with \\(p =1\\) predictor, and let \\(p_1(x)\\) and \\(p_2(x)=1−p_1(x)\\) be the probabilities that the observation \\(X = x\\) belongs to class 1 and class 2, respectively. In the LDA framework, we can see from Eq. (4.4) (and a bit of simple algebra) that the log odds is given by \\[ \\log \\bigg(\\frac{p_1(x)}{1-p_1(x)}\\bigg) = \\log \\bigg(\\frac{p_1(x)}{p_2(x)}\\bigg) = c_0 + c_1 x\\] where \\(c_0\\) and \\(c_1\\) are functions of \\(\\mu_1, \\mu_2,\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). On the other hand, we know that in logistic regression \\[ \\log \\bigg(\\frac{p_1}{1-p_1}\\bigg) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\] Both of the equations above are linear functions of \\(x\\). Hence both logistic regression and LDA produce linear decision boundaries. The only diﬀerence between the two approaches lies in the fact that \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are estimated using maximum likelihood, whereas \\(c_0\\) and \\(c_1\\) are computed using the estimated mean and variance from a normal distribution. This same connection between LDA and logistic regression also holds for multidimensional data with \\(p&gt; 1\\). Logistic regression uses the conditional likelihood based on P(Y|X) (known as discriminative learning). LDA uses the full likelihood based on P(X, Y) (known as generative learning). Despite these differences, in practice the results are often very similar. Remark: Logistic regression can also fit quadratic boundaries like QDA, by explicitly including quadratic terms in the model. ◼ "],

It is a model of Purchased in function of Age and EstimatedSalary. We will use this model to show the decision boundary in the next part of this PW. Then we will compare this model to other models obtained by Discriminant Analysis approaches. Decision Boundary of Logistic Regression Now you are going to visualize the decision boundary for logistic regression. Since the decision boundary of logistic regression is a linear (you know why right?) and the dimension of the feature space is 2 (Age and EstimatedSalary), the decision boundary in this 2-dimensional space is a line that separates the predicted classes “0” and “1” (values of the response Purchased). For logistic regression, we predict y = 1 if βTX ≥ 0 (right side of the line) and y = 0 if βTX &lt; 0 (left side of the line). Where \\[ \\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta2 \\end{pmatrix} \\,\\, \\text{and} \\,\\, X = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\] So we predict y = 1 if β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 ≥ 0 which means that the equation of the decision boundary (a line here) is \\(X_2 = - \\frac{\\beta_1}{\\beta_2}X_1 - \\frac{\\beta_0}{\\beta_2}\\) 2. Plot the decision boundary obtained with logistic regression. In order to do so, calculate the intercept and the slope of the line presenting the decision boundary, then plot EstimatedSalary in function of Age (from the test_set) and add the line using abline(). 3. In order to verify that your line (decision boundary) is well plotted, color the points on the last Figure with respect to the predicted response. Hints: If your predictions are stored in y_pred, you can do it using bg = ifelse(y_pred == 1, 'color1', 'color2'), and precise the argument pch to be 21 (you can choose pch to be a value between 21 and 25, try it). Then, add the line using abline(), put the line width = 2 to make it more visible. Do not forget to title the Figure). 4. Now make the same plot but color the points with respect to their real labels (the variable Purchased). From this figure, count the number of the false positive predictions and compare it to the value obtained in the confusion matrix. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Let us apply linear discriminant analysis (LDA) now. First we will make use of the lda() function in the package MASS. Second, you are going to create the model and predict the classes by yourself without using the lda() function. And we will visualize the decision boundary of LDA. 5. Fit a LDA model of Purchased in function of Age and EstimatedSalary. Name the model classifier.lda. library(MASS) classifier.lda &lt;- lda(Purchased~Age+EstimatedSalary, data=training_set) 6. Call classifier.lda and see what does it compute. Plus: If you enter the following you will be returned with a list of summary information concerning the computation: classifier.lda$prior classifier.lda$means 7. On the test set, predict the probability of purchasing the product by the users using the model classifier.lda. Remark that when we predict using LDA, we obtain a list instead of a matrix, do str() for your predictions to see what do you get. Remark: we get the predicted class here, without being obligated to round the predictions as we did for logistic regression. 8. Compute the confusion matrix and compare the predictions results obtained by LDA to the ones obtained by logistic regression. What do you remark? (Hint: compare the accuracy) 9. Now let us plot the decision boundary obtained with LDA. You saw in the course that decision boundary for LDA represent the set of values \\(x\\) where \\(\\delta_k(x) = \\delta_c(x)\\). Recall that \\[ \\delta_k(X) = x^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_k^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k + \\log \\pi_k \\] Here in our case, we have 2 classes (\\(K=2\\)) and 2 predictors (\\(p=2\\)). So the decision boundary (which is linear in the case of LDA, and line in our case since \\(p=2\\)) will verify the equation \\(\\delta_0(x) = \\delta_1(x)\\) Since we have two classes “0” and “1”. In the case of LDA this leads to linear boundary and is easy to be plotted. But in more complicated cases it is difficult to manually simplify the equations and plot the decision boundary. Anyway, there is a smart method to plot (but a little bit costy) the decision boundary in R using the function contour(), the corresponding code is the following (you must adapt it and use it to plot your decision boundary): # create a grid corresponding to the scales of Age and EstimatedSalary # and fill this grid with lot of points X1 = seq(min(training_set[, 1]) - 1, max(training_set[, 1]) + 1, by = 0.01) X2 = seq(min(training_set[, 2]) - 1, max(training_set[, 2]) + 1, by = 0.01) grid_set = expand.grid(X1, X2) # Adapt the variable names colnames(grid_set) = c(&#39;Age&#39;, &#39;EstimatedSalary&#39;) # plot &#39;Estimated Salary&#39; ~ &#39;Age&#39; plot(test_set[, 1:2], main = &#39;Decision Boundary LDA&#39;, xlab = &#39;Age&#39;, ylab = &#39;Estimated Salary&#39;, xlim = range(X1), ylim = range(X2)) # color the plotted points with their real label (class) points(test_set[1:2], pch = 21, bg = ifelse(test_set[, 3] == 1, &#39;green4&#39;, &#39;red3&#39;)) # Make predictions on the points of the grid, this will take some time pred_grid = predict(classifier.lda, newdata = grid_set)$class # Separate the predictions by a contour contour(X1, X2, matrix(as.numeric(pred_grid), length(X1), length(X2)), add = TRUE) 10. Now let us build a LDA model for our data set without using the lda() function. You are free to do it by creating a function or without creating one. Go back to question 6 and see what did you obtain by using lda(). It computes the prior probability of group membership and the estimated group means for each of the two groups. Additional information that is not provided, but may be important, is the single covariance matrix that is being used for the various groupings. In LDA, we compute for every observation x its discriminant score δk(x). Then we attribute x to the class that has the highest δ. Recall that \\[\\delta_k(x) = x^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_k^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k + \\log \\pi_k\\] So to compute δk(x) we need to estimate πk, μk and Σ. Note that \\[x=\\begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\] and here X1=Age and X2=EstimatedSalary. So let us do it step by step, first we will do the estimates: 10.1 Subset the training set into two sets: class0 where Purchased = 0 and class1 where Purchased = 1). 10.2 Compute \\(\\pi_0\\) and \\(\\pi_1\\). \\[\\pi_i = N_i / N, \\,\\, \\text{where} \\,\\, N_i \\,\\, \\text{is the number of data points in group } i\\] 10.3 Compute \\(\\mu_0\\) and \\(\\mu_1\\). \\[\\mu_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_0(X_1) \\\\ \\mu_0(X_2) \\end{pmatrix} \\,\\, \\text{and} \\,\\, \\mu_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_1(X_1) \\\\ \\mu_1(X_2) \\end{pmatrix}\\] where, for example, \\(\\mu_0(X_1)\\) is the mean of the variable \\(X_1\\) in the group \\(0\\) (the subset class0). 10.4 Compute \\(\\Sigma\\). In the case of two classes like here, it is computed by calculating the following: \\[\\Sigma = \\frac{(N_0-1)\\Sigma_0 + (N_1-1)\\Sigma_1}{N_0+N_1-2}\\] where \\(\\Sigma_i\\) is the estimated covariance matrix for specific group \\(i\\). Remark: Recall that in LDA we use the same \\(\\Sigma\\). But in QDA we do not. 10.5. Now that we have computed all the needed estimates, we can calculate \\(\\delta_0(x)\\) and \\(\\delta_1(x)\\) for any observation \\(x\\). And we will attribute \\(x\\) to the class with the highest \\(\\delta\\). First, try it for \\(x\\) where \\(x^T=(1,1.5)\\), what is class prediction for this spesific \\(x\\)? 10.6. Compute the discriminant scores \\(\\delta\\) for the test set (a matrix \\(100\\times 2\\)), predict the classes and compare your results with the results obtained with the lda() function. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) Training and assessing a QDA model in R is very similar in syntax to training and assessing a LDA model. The only difference is in the function name qda() 11. Fit a QDA model of Purchased in function of Age and EstimatedSalary. Name the model classifier.qda. # qda() is a function of library(MASS) classifier.qda &lt;- qda(Purchased~., data = training_set) 12. Make predictions on the test_set using the QDA model classifier.qda. Show the confusion matrix and compare the results with the predictions obtained using the LDA model classifier.lda. 13. Plot the decision boundary obtained with QDA. Color the points with the real labels. Comparison 14. In order to compare the methods we used, plot on the same Figure the ROC curve for each classifier we fitted and compare the correspondant AUC. What was the best model for this dataset? Remark: If you use the ROCR package: For Logistic regression, use the predicted probabilities in the prediction() (and not the round values “0” or “1”). For LDA and QDA, put pred.lda$posterior[,2] in the prediction() function (those are the posterior probabilities that observations belong to class “1”). ◼ "],

["principal-components-analysis.html", "6 Principal Components Analysis 6.1 Introduction 6.2 Principal Components 6.3 How do we find the coefficients? 6.4 Standardization of the features 6.5 Projection of the data 6.6 Case study", " 6 Principal Components Analysis 6.1 Introduction The central idea of principal component analysis (PCA) is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set consisting of a large number of interrelated variables, while retaining as much as possible of the variation present in the data set. This is achieved by transforming to a new set of variables, the principal components (PCs), which are uncorrelated, and which are ordered so that the first few retain most of the variation present in all of the original variables. Suppose that we wish to visualize \\(n\\) observations with measurements on a set of \\(p\\) features, \\(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_p\\), as part of an exploratory data analysis. We could do this by examining two-dimensional scatterplots of the data, each of which contains the \\(n\\) observations’ measurements on two of the features. However, there are \\(C_p^2 = p(p−1)/2\\) such scatterplots. For example, with \\(p =10\\) there are 45 plots! If \\(p\\) is large, then it will certainly not be possible to look at all of them; moreover, most likely none of them will be informative since they each contain just a small fraction of the total information present in the data set. Clearly, a better method is required to visualize the \\(n\\) observations when \\(p\\) is large. In particular, we would like to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that captures as much of the information as possible. PCA provides a tool to do just this. PCA finds a low-dimensional representation of a data set that contains as much as possible of the variation. The idea is that each of the \\(n\\) observations lives in \\(p\\)-dimensional space, but not all of these dimensions are equally interesting. PCA seeks a small number of dimensions that are as interesting as possible, where the concept of interesting is measured by the amount that the observations vary along each dimension. Each of the dimensions found by PCA is a linear combination of the \\(p\\) features. We now explain the manner in which these dimensions, or principal components, are found. 6.2 Principal Components Notations and Procedure Suppose that we have a random vector of the features \\(X\\). \\[ \\textbf{X} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} X_1\\\\ X_2\\\\ \\vdots \\\\X_p\\end{array}\\right) \\] with population variance-covariance matrix \\[ \\text{var}(\\textbf{X}) = \\Sigma = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\\sigma^2_1 &amp; \\sigma_{12} &amp; \\dots &amp;\\sigma_{1p}\\\\ \\sigma_{21} &amp; \\sigma^2_2 &amp; \\dots &amp;\\sigma_{2p}\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\sigma_{p1} &amp; \\sigma_{p2} &amp; \\dots &amp; \\sigma^2_p\\end{array}\\right) \\] Consider the linear combinations \\[ \\begin{array}{lll} Y_1 &amp; = &amp; a_{11}X_1 + a_{12}X_2 + \\dots + a_{1p}X_p \\\\ Y_2 &amp; = &amp; a_{21}X_1 + a_{22}X_2 + \\dots + a_{2p}X_p \\\\ &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\\\ Y_p &amp; = &amp; a_{p1}X_1 + a_{p2}X_2 + \\dots +a_{pp}X_p \\end{array} \\] Note that \\(Y_i\\) is a function of our random data, and so is also random. Therefore it has a population variance \\[ \\text{var}(Y_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{p} \\sum_{l=1}^{p} a_{ik} a_{il} \\sigma_{kl} = \\mathbf{a}^T_i \\Sigma \\mathbf{a}_i \\] Moreover, \\(Y_i\\) and \\(Y_j\\) will have a population covariance \\[ \\text{cov}(Y_i, Y_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^{p} \\sum_{l=1}^{p} a_{ik}a_{jl}\\sigma_{kl} = \\mathbf{a}^T_i\\Sigma\\mathbf{a}_j \\] and a correlation \\[ \\text{cor}(Y_i, Y_j) = \\frac{\\text{cov}(Y_i, Y_j)}{\\sigma^2_i \\sigma^2_j}\\] Here the coefficients \\(a_{ij}\\) are collected into the vector \\[ \\mathbf{a}_i = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} a_{i1}\\\\ a_{i2}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{ip}\\end{array}\\right) \\] The coefficients \\(a_{ij}\\) are also called loadings of the principal component \\(i\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a}_i\\) is a principal component loading vector. The total variation of X is the trace of the variance-covariance matrix Σ. The trace of Σ is the sum of the variances of the individual variables. trace(Σ)  =  σ12 + σ22 + … + σp2 First Principal Component (\\(\\text{PC}_1\\)): \\(Y_1\\) The first principal component is the normalized linear combination of the features \\(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_p\\) that has maximum variance (among all linear combinations), so it accounts for as much variation in the data as possible. Specifically we will define coefficients \\(a_{11},a_{12},\\ldots,a_{1p}\\) for that component in such a way that its variance is maximized, subject to the constraint that the sum of the squared coefficients is equal to one (that is what we mean by normalized). This constraint is required so that a unique answer may be obtained. More formally, select \\(a_{11},a_{12},\\ldots,a_{1p}\\) that maximizes \\[ \\text{var}(Y_1) = \\mathbf{a}^T_1\\Sigma\\mathbf{a}_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\sum_{l=1}^{p}a_{1k}a_{1l}\\sigma_{kl} \\] subject to the constraint that \\[ \\sum_{j=1}^{p}a^2_{1j} = \\mathbf{a}^T_1\\mathbf{a}_1 = 1 \\] Second Principal Component (\\(\\text{PC}_2\\)): \\(Y_2\\) The second principal component is the linear combination of the features \\(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_p\\) that accounts for as much of the remaining variation as possible, with the constraint that the correlation between the first and second component is 0. So the second principal component has maximal variance out of all linear combinations that are uncorrelated with \\(Y_1\\). To compute the coefficients of the second principal component, we select \\(a_{21},a_{22},\\ldots,a_{2p}\\) that maximizes the variance of this new component \\[\\text{var}(Y_2) = \\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\sum_{l=1}^{p}a_{2k}a_{2l}\\sigma_{kl} = \\mathbf{a}^T_2\\Sigma\\mathbf{a}_2 \\] subject to: The constraint that the sums of squared coefficients add up to one, \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{p}a^2_{2j} = \\mathbf{a}^T_2\\mathbf{a}_2 = 1\\). Along with the additional constraint that these two components will be uncorrelated with one another: \\[ \\text{cov}(Y_1, Y_2) = \\mathbf{a}^T_1\\Sigma\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\sum_{l=1}^{p}a_{1k}a_{2l}\\sigma_{kl} = 0 \\] All subsequent principal components have this same property: they are linear combinations that account for as much of the remaining variation as possible and they are not correlated with the other principal components. We will do this in the same way with each additional component. For instance: \\(i^{th}\\) Principal Component (\\(\\text{PC}_i\\)): \\(Y_i\\) We select \\(a_{i1},a_{i2},\\ldots,a_{ip}\\) that maximizes \\[ \\text{var}(Y_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\sum_{l=1}^{p}a_{ik}a_{il}\\sigma_{kl} = \\mathbf{a}^T_i\\Sigma\\mathbf{a}_i \\] subject to the constraint that the sums of squared coefficients add up to one, along with the additional constraint that this new component will be uncorrelated with all the previously defined components: \\[ \\sum_{j=1}^{p}a^2_{ij} \\mathbf{a}^T_i\\mathbf{a}_i = \\mathbf{a}^T_i\\mathbf{a}_i = 1\\] \\[ \\text{cov}(Y_1, Y_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\sum_{l=1}^{p}a_{1k}a_{il}\\sigma_{kl} = \\mathbf{a}^T_1\\Sigma\\mathbf{a}_i = 0 \\] \\[\\text{cov}(Y_2, Y_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\sum_{l=1}^{p}a_{2k}a_{il}\\sigma_{kl} = \\mathbf{a}^T_2\\Sigma\\mathbf{a}_i = 0\\] \\[\\vdots\\] \\[\\text{cov}(Y_{i-1}, Y_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\sum_{l=1}^{p}a_{i-1,k}a_{il}\\sigma_{kl} = \\mathbf{a}^T_{i-1}\\Sigma\\mathbf{a}_i = 0\\] Therefore all principal components are uncorrelated with one another. 6.3 How do we find the coefficients? How do we find the coefficients \\(a_{ij}\\) for a principal component? The solution involves the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the variance-covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). Let \\(\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_p\\) denote the eigenvalues of the variance-covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). These are ordered so that \\(\\lambda_1\\) has the largest eigenvalue and \\(\\lambda_p\\) is the smallest. \\[ \\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_p \\] We are also going to let the vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}_1, \\ldots,\\mathbf{a}_p\\) denote the corresponding eigenvectors. It turns out that the elements for these eigenvectors will be the coefficients of the principal components. The elements for the eigenvectors of Σ are the coefficients of the principal components. The variance for the \\(i\\)th principal component is equal to the \\(i\\)th eigenvalue. \\[ \\textbf{var}(Y_i) = \\text{var}(a_{i1}X_1 + a_{i2}X_2 + \\dots a_{ip}X_p) = \\lambda_i \\] Moreover, the principal components are uncorrelated with one another. \\[\\text{cov}(Y_i, Y_j) = 0\\] The variance-covariance matrix may be written as a function of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors. In fact, the variance-covariance matrix can be written as the sum over the \\(p\\) eigenvalues, multiplied by the product of the corresponding eigenvector times its transpose as shown in the following expression \\[ \\Sigma = \\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\lambda_i \\mathbf{a}_i \\mathbf{a}_i^T \\] If \\(\\lambda_{k+1}, \\lambda_{k+2}, \\dots , \\lambda_{p}\\) are small, we might approximate \\(\\Sigma\\) by \\[ \\Sigma \\cong \\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\lambda_i \\mathbf{a}_i\\mathbf{a}_i^T \\] Earlier in the chapter we defined the total variation of \\(X\\) as the trace of the variance-covariance matrix. This is also equal to the sum of the eigenvalues as shown below: \\[ \\begin{array}{lll}trace(\\Sigma) &amp; = &amp; \\sigma^2_1 + \\sigma^2_2 + \\dots +\\sigma^2_p \\\\ &amp; = &amp; \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\dots + \\lambda_p\\end{array} \\] This will give us an interpretation of the components in terms of the amount of the full variation explained by each component. The proportion of variation explained by the \\(i\\)th principal component is then going to be defined to be the eigenvalue for that component divided by the sum of the eigenvalues. In other words, the \\(i\\)th principal component explains the following proportion of the total variation: \\[ \\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\dots + \\lambda_p} \\] A related quantity is the proportion of variation explained by the first \\(k\\) principal component. This would be the sum of the first \\(k\\) eigenvalues divided by its total variation. \\[ \\frac{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\dots + \\lambda_k}{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\dots + \\lambda_p} \\] In practice, these proportions are often expressed as percentages. Naturally, if the proportion of variation explained by the first \\(k\\) principal components is large, then not much information is lost by considering only the first \\(k\\) principal components. Why It May Be Possible to Reduce Dimensions When we have correlations (multicollinarity) between the features, the data may more or less fall on a line or plane in a lower number of dimensions. For instance, imagine a plot of two features that have a nearly perfect correlation. The data points will fall close to a straight line. That line could be used as a new (one-dimensional) axis to represent the variation among data points. All of this is defined in terms of the population variance-covariance matrix Σ which is unknown. However, we may estimate Σ by the sample variance-covariance matrix which is given in the standard formula here: \\[ \\textbf{S} = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\\mathbf{X}_i-\\bar{\\textbf{x}})(\\mathbf{X}_i-\\bar{\\textbf{x}})^T \\] Procedure Compute the eigenvalues \\(\\hat{\\lambda}_1, \\hat{\\lambda}_2, \\dots, \\hat{\\lambda}_p\\) of the sample variance-covariance matrix \\(\\textbf{S}\\), and the corresponding eigenvectors \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_1, \\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_2, \\dots, \\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_p\\). Then we will define our estimated principal components using the eigenvectors as our coefficients: \\[ \\begin{array}{lll} \\hat{Y}_1 &amp; = &amp; \\hat{a}_{11}X_1 + \\hat{a}_{12}X_2 + \\dots + \\hat{a}_{1p}X_p \\\\ \\hat{Y}_2 &amp; = &amp; \\hat{a}_{21}X_1 + \\hat{a}_{22}X_2 + \\dots + \\hat{a}_{2p}X_p \\\\&amp;&amp;\\vdots\\\\ \\hat{Y}_p &amp; = &amp; \\hat{a}_{p1}X_1 + \\hat{a}_{p2}X_2 + \\dots + \\hat{a}_{pp}X_p \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Generally, we only retain the first \\(k\\) principal component. There are a number of criteria that may be used to decide how many components should be retained: To obtain the simplest possible interpretation, we want \\(k\\) to be as small as possible. If we can explain most of the variation just by two principal components then this would give us a much simpler description of the data. Retain the first \\(k\\) components which explain a “large” proportion of the total variation, say \\(70-80\\%\\). Examine a scree plot. This is a plot of the eigenvalues versus the component number. The idea is to look for the “elbow” which corresponds to the point after which the eigenvalues decrease more slowly. Adding components after this point explains relatively little more of the variance. See the next figure for an example of a scree plot. Scree plot showing eigenvalue by number of principal component. 6.4 Standardization of the features If we use the raw data, the principal component analysis will tend to give more emphasis to the variables that have higher variances than to those variables that have very low variances. In effect the results of the analysis will depend on what units of measurement are used to measure each variable. That would imply that a principal component analysis should only be used with the raw data if all variables have the same units of measure. And even in this case, only if you wish to give those variables which have higher variances more weight in the analysis. The results of principal component analysis depend on the scales at which the variables are measured. Variables with the highest sample variances will tend to be emphasized in the first few principal components. Principal component analysis using the covariance function should only be considered if all of the variables have the same units of measurement. If the variables either have different units of measurement, or if we wish each variable to receive equal weight in the analysis, then the variables should be standardized (scaled) before a principal components analysis is carried out. Standardize the variables by subtracting its mean from that variable and dividing it by its standard deviation: \\[Z_{ij} = \\frac{X_{ij}-\\bar{x}_j}{\\sigma_j}\\] where \\(X_{ij}\\) = Data for variable \\(j\\) in sample unit \\(i\\) \\(\\bar{x}_j\\) = Sample mean for variable \\(j\\) \\(\\sigma_j\\) = Sample standard deviation for variable \\(j\\) Note: \\(Z_j\\) has mean = 0 and variance = 1. The variance-covariance matrix of the standardized data is equal to the correlation matrix for the unstandardized data. Therefore, principal component analysis using the standardized data is equivalent to principal component analysis using the correlation matrix. Remark: You are going to prove it in the practical work session. 6.5 Projection of the data Scores Using the coefficients (loadings) of every principal component, we can project the observations on the axis of the principal component, those projections are called scores. For example, the scores of the first principal component are \\[ \\forall 1 \\le i \\le n \\quad \\hat{Y}_1^i = \\hat{a}_{11}X_1^i + \\hat{a}_{12}X_2^i + \\dots + \\hat{a}_{1p}X_p^i \\] (\\(X_1^i\\) is the value of feature \\(1\\) for the observation \\(i\\)) This can be written for all observations and all the principal components using the matrix formulation \\[ \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{A}} X\\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{A}}\\) is the matrix of the coefficients \\(\\hat{a}_{ij}\\). Visualization Once we have computed the principal components, we can plot them against each other in order to produce low-dimensional views of the data. We can plot the score vector \\(Y_1\\) against \\(Y_2\\), \\(Y_1\\) against \\(Y_3\\), \\(Y_2\\) against \\(Y_3\\), and so forth. Geometrically, this amounts to projecting the original data down onto the subspace spanned by \\(\\mathbf{a}_1\\), \\(\\mathbf{a}_2\\), and \\(\\mathbf{a}_3\\), and plotting the projected points. To interpret the results obtained by PCA, we plot on the same figure both the principal component scores and the loading vectors. This figure is called a biplot. An example is given later in this chapter. Extra You can read this tutorial . In the document, there is an introduction about the mathemtical concepts used in PCA. Plus a detailed example of PCA. You can watch these videos for a nice explanation of PCA 1 2. 6.6 Case study Employement in European countries in the late 70s The purpose of this case study is to reveal the structure of the job market and economy in different developed countries. The final aim is to have a meaningful and rigorous plot that is able to show the most important features of the countries in a concise form. The dataset eurojob contains the data employed in this case study. It contains the percentage of workforce employed in 1979 in 9 industries for 26 European countries. The industries measured are: Agriculture (Agr) Mining (Min) Manufacturing (Man) Power supply industries (Pow) Construction (Con) Service industries (Ser) Finance (Fin) Social and personal services (Soc) Transport and communications (Tra) If the dataset is imported into R and the case names are set as Country (important in order to have only numerical variables), then the data should look like this: Table 6.1: The eurojob dataset.

PCA will be a handy way. Recall what PCA does: Takes the data for the variables \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_p\\). Using this data, looks for new variables \\(\\text{PC}_1,\\ldots \\text{PC}_p\\) such that: \\(\\text{PC}_j\\) is a linear combination of \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_k\\), \\(1\\leq j\\leq p\\). This is, \\(\\text{PC}_j=a_{1j}X_1+a_{2j}X_2+\\ldots+a_{pj}X_p\\). \\(\\text{PC}_1,\\ldots \\text{PC}_p\\) are sorted decreasingly in terms of variance. Hence \\(\\text{PC}_j\\) has more variance than \\(\\text{PC}_{j+1}\\), \\(1\\leq j\\leq p-1\\), \\(\\text{PC}_{j_1}\\) and \\(\\text{PC}_{j_2}\\) are uncorrelated, for \\(j_1\\neq j_2\\). \\(\\text{PC}_1,\\ldots \\text{PC}_p\\) have the same information, measured in terms of total variance, as \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_p\\). Produces three key objects: Variances of the PCs. They are sorted decreasingly and give an idea of which PCs are contain most of the information of the data (the ones with more variance). Weights of the variables in the PCs. They give the interpretation of the PCs in terms of the original variables, as they are the coefficients of the linear combination. The weights of the variables \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_p\\) on the PC\\(_j\\), \\(a_{1j},\\ldots,a_{pj}\\), are normalized: \\(a_{1j}^2+\\ldots+a_{pj}^2=1\\), \\(j=1,\\ldots,p\\). In R, they are called loadings. Scores of the data in the PCs: this is the data with \\(\\text{PC}_1,\\ldots \\text{PC}_p\\) variables instead of \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_p\\). The scores are uncorrelated. Useful for knowing which PCs have more effect on a certain observation. Hence, PCA rearranges our variables in an information-equivalent, but more convenient, layout where the variables are sorted according to the ammount of information they are able to explain. From this position, the next step is clear: stick only with a limited number of PCs such that they explain most of the information (e.g., 70% of the total variance) and do dimension reduction. The effectiveness of PCA in practice varies from the structure present in the dataset. For example, in the case of highly dependent data, it could explain more than the 90% of variability of a dataset with tens of variables with just two PCs.

This implies that: The PCs are uncorrelated, but not independent (uncorrelated does not imply independent). An uncorrelated or independent variable in X1, …, Xp will get a PC only associated to it. In the extreme case where all the X1, …, Xp are uncorrelated, these coincide with the PCs (up to sign flips). Based on the weights of the variables on the PCs, we can extract the following interpretation: PC1 is roughly a linear combination of Agr, with negative weight, and (Man, Pow, Con, Ser, Soc, Tra), with positive weights. So it can be interpreted as an indicator of the kind of economy of the country: agricultural (negative values) or industrial (positive values). PC2 has negative weights on (Min, Man, Pow, Tra) and positive weights in (Ser, Fin, Soc). It can be interpreted as the contrast between relatively large or small service sectors. So it tends to be negative in communist countries and positive in capitalist countries. The interpretation of the PCs involves inspecting the weights and interpreting the linear combination of the original variables, which might be separating between two clear characteristics of the data To conclude, let’s see how we can represent our original data into a plot called biplot that summarizes all the analysis for two PCs. # Biplot - plot together the scores for PC1 and PC2 and the # variables expressed in terms of PC1 and PC2 biplot(pca) ◼ "],

["app-ht.html", "B Review on hypothesis testing", " B Review on hypothesis testing The process of hypothesis testing has an interesting analogy with a trial that helps on understanding the elements present in a formal hypothesis test in an intuitive way. Hypothesis testing Trial Null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) Accused of comitting a crime. It has the “presumption of innocence”, which means that it is not guilty until there is enough evidence to supporting its guilt Sample \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_n\\) Collection of small evidences supporting innocence and guilt. These evidences contain a certain degree of uncontrollable randomness because of how they were collected and the context regarding the case Statistic \\(T_n\\) Summary of the evicences presented by the prosecutor and defense lawyer Distribution of \\(T_n\\) under \\(H_0\\) The judge conducting the trial. Evaluates the evidence presented by both sides and presents a verdict for \\(H_0\\) Significance level \\(\\alpha\\) \\(1-\\alpha\\) is the strength of evidences required by the judge for condemning \\(H_0\\). The judge allows evidences that on average condemn \\(100\\alpha\\%\\) of the innocents, due to the randomness inherent to the evidence collection process. \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) is considered a reasonable level \\(p\\)-value Decision of the judge that measures the degree of compatibility, in a scale \\(0\\)–\\(1\\), of the presumption of innocence with the summary of the evidences presented. If \\(p\\)-value\\(&lt;\\alpha\\), \\(H_0\\) is declared guilty. Otherwise, is declared not guilty \\(H_0\\) is rejected \\(H_0\\) is declared guilty: there are strong evidences supporting its guilt \\(H_0\\) is not rejected \\(H_0\\) is declared not guilty: either is innocent or there are no enough evidences supporting its guilt More formally, the \\(p\\)-value of an hypothesis test about \\(H0\\) is defined as: The \\(p\\)-value is the probability of obtaining a statistic more unfavourable to \\(H_0\\) than the observed, assuming that \\(H_0\\) is true. Therefore, if the \\(p\\)-value is small (smaller than the chosen level \\(\\alpha\\)), it is unlikely that the evidence against \\(H_0\\) is due to randomness. As a consequence, \\(H_0\\) is rejected. If the \\(p\\)-value is large (larger than \\(\\alpha\\)), then it is more possible that the evidences against \\(H_0\\) are merely due to the randomness of the data. In this case, we do not reject \\(H_0\\). If H0 holds, then the p-value (which is a random variable) is distributed uniformly in (0, 1). If H0 does not hold, then the distribution of the p-value is not uniform but concentrated at 0 (where the rejections of H0 take place). "],
["use-qual.html", "C Use of qualitative predictors", " C Use of qualitative predictors An important situation is how to deal with qualitative, and not quantitative, predictors when we fit a regression model. Qualitative predictors, also known as categorical variables or, in R’s terminology, factors, are very common, for example in social sciences. Dealing with them requires some care and proper understanding of how these variables are represented. The simplest case is the situation with two levels. A binary variable \\(C\\) with two levels (for example, a and b) can be represented as \\[ D=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1,&amp;\\text{if }C=b,\\\\ 0,&amp;\\text{if }C=a. \\end{array}\\right. \\] \\(D\\) now is a dummy variable: it codifies with zeros and ones the two possible levels of the categorical variable. An example of \\(C\\) could be gender, which has levels male and female. The dummy variable associated is \\(D=0\\) if the gender is male and \\(D=1\\) if the gender is female. The advantage of this dummification is its interpretability in regression models. Since level a corresponds to \\(0\\), it can be seen as the reference level to which level b is compared. This is the key point in dummification: set one level as the reference and codify the rest as departures from it with ones. R does the dummification automatically (translates a categorical variable \\(C\\) into its dummy version \\(D\\)) if it detects that a factor variable is present in the regression model. Let’s see now the case with more than two levels, for example, a categorical variable \\(C\\) with levels a, b, and c. If we take a as the reference level, this variable can be represented by two dummy variables: \\[ D_1=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}1,&amp;\\text{if }C=b,\\\\0,&amp; \\text{if }C\\neq b\\end{array}\\right. \\] and \\[ D_2=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}1,&amp;\\text{if }C=c,\\\\0,&amp; \\text{if }C\\neq c.\\end{array}\\right. \\] Then \\(C=a\\) is represented by \\(D_1=D_2=0\\), \\(C=b\\) is represented by \\(D_1=1,D_2=0\\) and \\(C=c\\) is represented by \\(D_1=0,D_2=1\\). In general, if we have a categorical variable with \\(J\\) levels, then the number of dummy variables required is \\(J-1\\). Again, R does the dummification automatically for you if it detects that a factor variable is present in the regression model. It may happen that one dummy variable, say D1 is not significant, while other dummy variables, say D2, are significant. Do not codify a categorical variable as a discrete variable. This constitutes a major methodological fail that will flaw the subsequent statistical analysis. For example if you have a categorical variable party with levels partyA, partyB, and partyC, do not encode it as a discrete variable taking the values 1, 2, and 3, respectively. If you do so: You assume implicitly an order in the levels of party, since partyA is closer to partyB than to partyC. You assume implicitly that partyC is three times larger than partyA. The codification is completely arbitrary – why not considering 1, 1.5, and 1.75 instead of? The right way of dealing with categorical variables in regression is to set the variable as a factor and let R do internally the dummification. "],
["pw5-annexe.html", "D PW5 - Annexe", " D PW5 - Annexe Concernant la séance 5: J’ai remarqué que la majorité n’a pas compris ce qu’il fallait faire! Le but de la séance est d’exploiter et analyser un jeu de données. La première chose à faire est la phase descriptive où on décrit les données, les variables, quelques figures descriptives, etc.. Ensuite il faut regarder la variable cible, qu’on souhaite modéliser et prédire. Selon le type de cette variable on décide la direction de l’analyse: 1- Variable cible quantitative: On fait la regression. Donc ce qui est important dans ce cas est d’étudier les corrélations entre les variables (prédicteurs) et en particulier entre les corrélations entre les prédicteurs et la variable cible. Ensuite sur le training set construire le modèle de régression. Pour cette tâche, vous pouvez commencer par un modèle qui prend tous les prédicteurs, et ensuite commencer à enlever les prédicteurs non significatives (comme on a fait en tp, c’est en fait la méthode backward). Vous pouvez tout de même pour la régression appliquer les méthodes décrites dans les vidéos du chapitre 5 pour faciliter la recherche du meilleur modèle. Une fois le modèle est trouvé, reste à faire la prédiction (sur le test set) et la performance du modèle. 2- Variable cible qualitative: Alors on fait la classification. Comme la variable cible est qualitative vous pouvez étudier la relation entre les prédicteurs et cette variable (boxplots, mosaicplots, etc..). Si la variable cible a 2 classes, vous pouvez construire des modèles de classifications vus en cours, prédire, ensuite comparer la performance de vos modèles (matrices de confusion, accuracy, courbes roc, etc..). Attention, on peut suivre les méthodes expliquées dans les vidéos du chapitre 5, mais pas avec les mêmes codes! la démarche expliquée dans les vidéos est commune, mais pour la classification il faut utiliser une autre librairie que “leaps”, par exemple “bestglm”. Si la variable cible a plus que 2 classes, pas besoin d’appliquer la régression logistique (raison expliquée dans le cours!), il suffit d’appliquer les méthodes discriminantes du chapitre 4. Attention, la courbe roc n’est pas applicable dans ce cas, on compare la performance en utilisant la matrice de confusion (au moins l’accuracy!). Mais d’autre part, vous pouvez quand même transformer le problème en deux classes, il s’agit de l’approche one-vs-all: c’est à dire considérer la classe 0 contre tous les autres classes à la fois. Ps, il ne vous faut pas la correction des tps pour pouvoir faire tout ce qui est décrit ci dessus. Vous avez suffisamment des exemples dans le cous, et dans l’énoncé du tp4, vous avez un exemple détaillé avec des commentaires aussi. Voilà. "],
