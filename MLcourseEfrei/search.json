    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nAs we saw previously, Logistic regression involves directly modeling \\(\\mathbb{P} (Y = k|X = x)\\) using the logistic function, for the case of two response classes. In logistic regression, we model the conditional distribution of the response \\(Y\\), given the predictor(s) \\(X\\). We now consider an alternative and less direct approach to estimating these probabilities. In this alternative approach, we model the distribution of the predictors \\(X\\) separately in each of the response classes (i.e. given \\(Y\\)), and then use Bayes’ theorem to flip these around into estimates for \\(\\mathbb{P} (Y = k|X = x)\\). When these distributions are assumed to be Normal, it turns out that the model is very similar in form to logistic regression.\nWhy not logistic regression? Why do we need another method, when we have logistic regression? There are several reasons:\n\nWhen the classes are well-separated, the parameter estimates for the logistic regression model are surprisingly unstable. Linear discriminant analysis does not suﬀer from this problem.\nIf \\(n\\) is small and the distribution of the predictors \\(X\\) is approximately normal in each of the classes, the linear discriminant model is again more stable than the logistic regression model.\nLinear discriminant analysis is popular when we have more than two response classes."

It is called the posterior probability.\n\n\\(P(A)\\), is called the prior, is the initial degree of belief in A.\n\n\\(P(B)\\) is the likelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe posterior probability can be written in the memorable form as :\nPosterior probability \\(\\propto\\) Likelihood \\(\\times\\) Prior probability.\n\n\nExtended form:\nSuppose we have a partition \\(\\{A_i\\}\\) of the sample space, the even space is given or conceptualized in terms of \\(P(A_j)\\) and \\(P(B | A_j)\\). It is then useful to compute \\(P(B)\\) using the law of total probability:\n\\[ P(B) = \\sum_j P(B|A_j) P(A_j) \\]\n\\[ \\Rightarrow P(A_i|B) = \\frac{P(B|A_i) P(A_i)}{\\sum_j P(B|A_j) P(A_j)} \\]\nBayes’ Theorem for Classification:\nSuppose that we wish to classify an observation into one of \\(K\\) classes, where \\(K \\geq 2\\). In other words, the qualitative response variable \\(Y\\) can take on \\(K\\) possible distinct and unordered values.\nLet \\(\\pi_k\\) represent the overall or prior probability that a randomly chosen observation comes from the \\(k\\)-th class; this is the probability that a given observation is associated with the \\(k\\)-th category of the response variable \\(Y\\).\nLet \\(f_k(X) \\equiv P(X = x|Y = k)\\) denote the density function of \\(X\\) for an observation that comes from the \\(k\\)-th class. In other words, \\(f_k(x)\\) is relatively large if there is a high probability that an observation in the \\(k\\)-th class has \\(X \\approx x\\), and \\(f_k(x)\\) is small if it is very unlikely that an observation in the \\(k\\)-th class has \\(X \\approx x\\). Then Bayes’ theorem states that\n\\[\nP(Y=k|X=x) = \\frac{ \\pi_k f_k(x)}{\\sum_{c=1}^K \\pi_c f_c(x)}\n\\qquad(1.1)\\]\nAs we did in the last chapter, we will use the abbreviation \\(p_k(X) =P(Y = k|X)\\).\nThe equation above stated by Bayes’ theorem suggests that instead of directly computing \\(p_k(X)\\) as we did in the logistic regression, we can simply plug in estimates of \\(\\pi_k\\) and \\(f_k(X)\\) into the equation. In general, estimating \\(\\pi_k\\) is easy (the fraction of the training observations that belong to the \\(k\\)-th class). But estimating \\(f_k(X)\\) tends to be more challenging.\n\nRecall that \\(p_k(x)\\) is the posterior probability that an observation \\(X=x\\) belongs to \\(k\\)-th class.\n\n\nIf we can find a way to estimate \\(f_k(X)\\), we can develop a classifier with the lowest possibe error rate out of all classifiers."

We assume that \\(X=(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_p)\\) is drawn from multivariate Gaussian distribution (assuming they have a common covariance matrix, e.g. same variances as in the case of \\(p=1\\)). The multivariate Gaussian distribution assumes that each individual predictor follows a one-dimensional normal distribution as in Equation (1.2), with some correlation between each pair of predictors.\nTo indicate that a \\(p\\)-dimensional random variable \\(X\\) has a multivariate Gaussian distribution, we write \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)\\).

This is the vector/matrix version of (1.4).\nAn example is shown in the following figure. Three equally-sized Gaussian classes are shown with class-specific mean vectors and a common covariance matrix (\\(\\pi_1=\\pi_2=\\pi_3=1/3\\)). The three ellipses represent regions that contain \\(95\\%\\) of the probability for each of the three classes. The dashed lines are the Bayes decision boundaries.\n\n\n\nRecall that the decision boundaries represent the set of values \\(x\\) for which \\(\\delta_k(x)=\\delta_c(x)\\); i.e. for \\(k\\neq c\\).\n\\[ x^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_k^T \\Sigma^{-1}  \\mu_k = x^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_c - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_c^T \\Sigma^{-1}  \\mu_c  \\]\nNote that there are three lines representing the Bayes decision boundaries because there are three pairs of classes among the three classes. That is, one Bayes decision boundary separates class 1 from class 2, one separates class 1 from class 3, and one separates class 2 from class 3. These three Bayes decision boundaries divide the predictor space into three regions. The Bayes classiﬁer will classify an observation according to the region in which it is located.\nOnce again, we need to estimate the unknown parameters \\(\\mu_1,\\ldots,\\mu_k,\\) and \\(\\pi_1,\\ldots,\\pi_k,\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\); the formulas are similar to those used in the one-dimensional case. To assign a new observation \\(X = x\\), LDA plugs these estimates into Equation (1.6) and classiﬁes to the class for which \\(\\delta_k(x)\\) is largest.\nNote that in Equation (1.6) \\(\\delta_k(x)\\) is a linear function of \\(x\\); that is, the LDA decision rule depends on \\(x\\) only through a linear combination of its elements (e.g. the decision boundaries are linear). This is the reason for the word linear in LDA."

Second, you are going to create the model and predict the classes by yourself without using the lda() function. And we will visualize the decision boundary of LDA.\n2. Fit a LDA model of Purchased in function of Age and EstimatedSalary. Name the model classifier.lda.\n\nlibrary(MASS)\nclassifier.lda <- lda(Purchased~Age+EstimatedSalary, data=training_set)\n\n3.

On the test set, predict the probability of purchasing the product by the users using the model classifier.lda. Remark that when we predict using LDA, we obtain a list instead of a matrix, do str() for your predictions to see what do you get.\nRemark: we get the predicted class here, without being obligated to round the predictions as we did for logistic regression.\n\n\n\n5. Compute the confusion matrix and compare the predictions results obtained by LDA to the ones obtained by logistic regression. What do you remark? (Hint: compare the accuracy)\n\n\n\n6. Now let us plot the decision boundary obtained with LDA. You saw in the course that decision boundary for LDA represent the set of values \\(x\\) where \\(\\delta_k(x) = \\delta_c(x)\\). Recall that\n\\[\\delta_k(X) = x^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_k^T \\Sigma^{-1}  \\mu_k + \\log \\pi_k\\]\nHere in our case, we have 2 classes (\\(K=2\\)) and 2 predictors (\\(p=2\\)). So the decision boundary (which is linear in the case of LDA, and line in our case since \\(p=2\\)) will verify the equation \\(\\delta_0(x) = \\delta_1(x)\\) Since we have two classes “0” and “1”. In the case of LDA this leads to linear boundary and is easy to be plotted. But in more complicated cases it is difficult to manually simplify the equations and plot the decision boundary. Anyway, there is a smart method to plot (but a little bit costy) the decision boundary in R using the function contour(), the corresponding code is the following (you must adapt it and use it to plot your decision boundary):\n\n# create a grid corresponding to the scales of Age and EstimatedSalary\n# and fill this grid with lot of points\nX1 = seq(min(training_set[, 1]) - 1, max(training_set[, 1]) + 1, by = 0.01)\nX2 = seq(min(training_set[, 2]) - 1, max(training_set[, 2]) + 1, by = 0.01)\ngrid_set = expand.grid(X1, X2)\n# Adapt the variable names\ncolnames(grid_set) = c('Age', 'EstimatedSalary')\n\n# plot 'Estimated Salary' ~ 'Age'\nplot(test_set[, 1:2],\n     main = 'Decision Boundary LDA',\n     xlab = 'Age', ylab = 'Estimated Salary',\n     xlim = range(X1), ylim = range(X2))\n\n# color the plotted points with their real label (class)\npoints(test_set[1:2], pch = 21, bg = ifelse(test_set[, 3] == 1, 'green4', 'red3'))\n\n# Make predictions on the points of the grid, this will take some time\npred_grid = predict(classifier.lda, newdata = grid_set)$class\n\n# Separate the predictions by a contour\ncontour(X1, X2, matrix(as.numeric(pred_grid), length(X1), length(X2)), add = TRUE)"

Go back to question 6 and see what did you obtain by using lda(). It computes the prior probability of group membership and the estimated group means for each of the two groups. Additional information that is not provided, but may be important, is the single covariance matrix that is being used for the various groupings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn LDA, we compute for every observation \\(x\\) its discriminant score \\(\\delta_k(x)\\). Then we attribute \\(x\\) to the class that has the highest \\(\\delta\\). Recall that\n\\[\\delta_k(x) = x^T \\Sigma^{-1} \\mu_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_k^T \\Sigma^{-1}  \\mu_k + \\log \\pi_k\\]\nSo to compute \\(\\delta_k(x)\\) we need to estimate \\(\\pi_k\\), \\(\\mu_k\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\).\nNote that \\[x=\\begin{pmatrix}\n            X_1 \\\\\n            X_2\n            \\end{pmatrix}\\] and here \\(X_1\\)=Age and \\(X_2\\)=EstimatedSalary.\n\n\nSo let us do it step by step, first we will do the estimates:\n11.1 Subset the training set into two sets: class0 where Purchased = 0 and class1 where Purchased = 1).\n11.2 Compute \\(\\pi_0\\) and \\(\\pi_1\\).\n\\[\\pi_i = N_i / N, \\,\\, \\text{where} \\,\\, N_i \\,\\, \\text{is the number of data points in group i}\\]\n11.3 Compute \\(\\mu_0\\) and \\(\\mu_1\\).\n\\[\\mu_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   \\mu_0(X_1) \\\\\n   \\mu_0(X_2)\n   \\end{pmatrix} \\,\\, \\text{and} \\,\\, \\mu_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   \\mu_1(X_1) \\\\\n   \\mu_1(X_2)\n   \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nwhere, for example, \\(\\mu_0(X_1)\\) is the mean of the variable \\(X_1\\) in the group \\(0\\) (the subset class0).\n11.4 Compute \\(\\Sigma\\). In the case of two classes like here, it is computed by calculating the following:\n\\[\\Sigma = \\frac{(N_0-1)\\Sigma_0 + (N_1-1)\\Sigma_1}{N_0+N_1-2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\Sigma_i\\) is the estimated covariance matrix for specific group \\(i\\).\nRemark: Recall that in LDA we use the same \\(\\Sigma\\). But in QDA we do not.\n11.5. Now that we have computed all the needed estimates, we can calculate \\(\\delta_0(x)\\) and \\(\\delta_1(x)\\) for any observation \\(x\\). And we will attribute \\(x\\) to the class with the highest \\(\\delta\\). First, try it for \\(x\\) where \\(x^T=(1,1.5)\\), what is class prediction for this spesific \\(x\\)?\n11.6. Compute the discriminant scores \\(\\delta\\) for the test set (a matrix \\(100\\times 2\\)), predict the classes and compare your results with the results obtained with the lda() function.\n\n\n\n\n◼"
