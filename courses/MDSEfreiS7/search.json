    "text": "Welcome\nMachine learning is powered by four critical concepts and is Statistics, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Calculus. While statistical concepts are the core part of every model, calculus helps us learn and optimize a model. Linear algebra comes exceptionally handy when we are dealing with a huge dataset and probability helps in predicting the livelihood of events that will be occurring. These are the mathematical concepts that you will encounter in your data science and machine learning career quite frequently.\nIn this course we are going to concentrate on Statistics & Probability.\nThis course is destined for students of majors Data & Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering at EFREI Paris engineering school."
