This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using a modified version of the [beautiful-jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme.

Some icons are loaded using [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [Academicons](http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/).

List of publications is generated using [Jekyll Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar).

The contact form is powered by [Formspree](https://formspree.io/).

I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and some of its wonderful [packages](https://packagecontrol.io/) to edit my code.

I use [Rbookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) in [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to write some of my courses.
